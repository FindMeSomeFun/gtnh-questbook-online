1483Really OP FoodYo'veu heard about Dezil's Marshmallow, a really OP food which can be found from time to time in chests. What about I show you a way to cook this stuff yourself?

After you've mastered the flowing spirit in the dream dimension (witchery), put a bit of flour, sugar, salis mundus and draconium dust in your IV Mixer. 
The recipe starts when you give flowing spirit to it and gives you malformed slush, a very stinky and disgusting piece of...something. 

Be careful, you'll get blindness II when holding it in your hand.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~585Quest Name For 14101410witchery/ingredient~96Quest Name For 15841584rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~8Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinChemistII~0Item Name2tasksANDOptionalwitchery/bucketspirit~0witchery/bucketspirit~0 Name2Retrievaldreamcraft/item.MalformedSlush~0dreamcraft/item.MalformedSlush~0 Name2
