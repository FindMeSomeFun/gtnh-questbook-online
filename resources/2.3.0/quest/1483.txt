1483Really OP FoodYo'veu heard about Dezil's Marshmallow, a really OP food which can be found from time to time in chests. What about I show you a way to cook this stuff yourself?

After you've mastered the flowing spirit in the dream dimension (witchery), put a bit of flour, sugar, salis mundus and draconium dust in your IV Mixer. 
The recipe starts when you give flowing spirit to it and gives you malformed slush, a very stinky and disgusting piece of...something. 

Be careful, you'll get blindness II when holding it in your hand.ANDpreRequ1410gregtech/gt.blockmachines~5851584witchery/ingredient~96tasksANDoptional_retrievalwitchery/bucketspirit~02retrievaldreamcraft/item.MalformedSlush~02rewardschoicewitchery/bucketspirit~01enhancedlootbags/lootbag~81itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~02dreamcraft/item.CoinCookII~02dreamcraft/item.CoinChemistII~02
