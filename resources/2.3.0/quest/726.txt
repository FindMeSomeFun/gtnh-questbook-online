When you put both machines next to each other you can output the molten rubber directly to the assembling machine by clicking the fluid auto-output button on the chemical reactor. Make sure to set the correct side of the reactor as output side by wrenching it. Also remember to use the right circuit in the assembling machine.ANDpre5431gregtech/gt.blockmachines-421.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-4.pngLootBag\nYou feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...\nEnchant with a Fortune III Book
