GalaxySpace/item.Tier7Rocket-0.pngAll Good Things...So you've built your T7 rocket. Great, there's only one more left. Until then, the new places you can visit are: Haumea, the Kuiper Belt, Makemake, and Pluto.

Pluto is just before the Kuiper Belt, and Haumea and Makemake are just after.

The new veins are Black Plutonium, Garnet, Red Garnet. The ores are: Black Plutonium, Borax, Chrysotile, Garnet Sand, Nether Star, Realgar, Red Garnet, and Yellow Garnet.
 
Don't forget the planet blocks!
 
The last schematic is on Pluto. This is also the last dungeon.0-1ANDpre26131gregtech/gt.blockmachines-18.png26421GalaxySpace/item.Tier7Rocket-0.pngrewardstasksANDCheckboxcheckbox-.pngCheckbox
