Personal anchors can be powered with ender fragments for 1h, ender pearls for 4 hours, and a varying amount depending on the coin used. 

Personal Anchors are loaded once the owner visits, and stays loaded while the player is logged in.

Passive Anchors are loaded once the owner visits, and stays loaded until the server resets.

World Anchors are always loaded, even after a server reset.ANDpre1021gregtech/gt.blockmachines-251.pngrewardsItemminecraft/ender_pearl-0.pngEnder Pearl
