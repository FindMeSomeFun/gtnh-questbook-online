Railcraft/machine.alpha-2.png§5§lPersonal ChunkloadingLet's craft a personal chunkloader. It will load a 3x3 chunk area. You need ender fragments, ender pearls, or coins to power the chunkloader. 

Personal anchors can be powered with ender fragments for 1h, ender pearls for 4 hours, and a varying amount depending on the coin used. 

§aPersonal Anchors§r are loaded once the owner visits, and stays loaded while the player is logged in.

§9Passive Anchors§r are loaded once the owner visits, and stays loaded until the server resets.

§4World Anchors§r are always loaded, even after a server reset.0-1ANDpre1021gregtech/gt.blockmachines-251.pngrewardsItemminecraft/ender_pearl-0.pngEnder Pearl\n1H Chunkloader Use in Passive and 4H in Personal Chunkloader
