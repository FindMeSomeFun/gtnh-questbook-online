Thaumcraft/blockMetalDevice-7.pngLight It Up!The arcane lamp creates additional light sources which acts like a Torch in a sphere with a radius of 16 blocks centered on it. This will include caves or other areas behind walls. That might be useful... One downside, it might put a light where one isn't wanted, like inside an EBF. 

When attached to the base of an arcane bore, the arcane lamp gains an additional ability: It will light up the tunnel that the bore digs.0-1ANDpre13690Thaumcraft/ItemResource-6.pngrewardsItemThaumcraft/blockCosmeticOpaque-0.pngAmber Block
