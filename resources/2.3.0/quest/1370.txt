1370Light It Up!The arcane lamp creates additional light sources which acts like a Torch in a sphere with a radius of 16 blocks centered on it. This will include caves or other areas behind walls. That might be useful... One downside, it might put a light where one isn't wanted, like inside an EBF. 

When attached to the base of an arcane bore, the arcane lamp gains an additional ability: It will light up the tunnel that the bore digs.ANDpreRequThaumcraft/ItemResource~6Quest Name For 13691369rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~9Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizard~0Item Name25tasksANDRetrievalThaumcraft/blockMetalDevice~7Thaumcraft/blockMetalDevice~7 Name1
