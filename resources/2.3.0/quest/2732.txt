2732The Third Time's the CharmThe Lapotronic Supercapacitor is an alternative to the Power Sub-Station (or Power Station Control Node as indicated on the controller) and the LESU. It is harder to make, but has its own benefits:

1) It looks cooler
2) Hatch tier is not limited by the capacitors like cells, so you can use whatever hatch tier you want if you store up power or have the input for it
3) Can mix and match Capacitor tiers
4) Loses 1% of total capacity every 24h, so much much less, but you can't cheese it
5) Actually stores way more power at IV+ tier

It also has downsides of course:
1) More expensive to make
2) Stores less power, though this is only the case with EV
3) Can only I/O on the bottom 2 layers
4) Can't cheese power loss
5) It can have maintenance issues, unlike the PSS, voiding 20% more power per, so try not to let that slide. Though at most it's still only 2.2%

For the first, smallest one, you'll need the following, plus an Energy Hatch and a Dynamo (or the laser equivalents). Remember that you can get your Lapos back if you run the capacitor through an unpackager. Finally a reason to make one!

You can use Laser Hatches, that can output very high amperage. You need at least UV Glass to use them. (This is also the case with PSS BTW.)

BTW your LSC can hold between 540M and 8.1B EU using only the EV capacitors. Remember that you need more than half the blocks to be non-empty capacitors for it to be valid.ANDpreRequIC2/itemBatLamaCrystal~1Quest Name For 806806gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32706Quest Name For 12611261rewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32714Item Name15Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name2tasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~90gregtech/gt.blockmachines~90 Name1Optionalkekztech/kekztech_lapotronicenergyunit_block~6kekztech/kekztech_lapotronicenergyunit_block~6 Name4Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~13106gregtech/gt.blockmachines~13106 Name1
