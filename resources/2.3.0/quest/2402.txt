gregtech/gt.metatool.01-20-Neutronium-Neutronium.png§2§lGot a Flat Tire?The crowbar is the GT tool used to remove a cover off of a machine, pipe, or wire. Covers can be decorative, functional like pumps and conveyors, or for safety, like putting a wooden plank over your steam pipes so they don't burn you.
