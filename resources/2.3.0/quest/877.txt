877Scepter With 75 Vis CapacityA scepter is crafted from a wand core, a primal charm, three wand caps, a twilight forest monster mob drop, and some screws. Any sort of core or cap may be used, but the caps must match each other. A scepter cannot hold a focus, but holds 150 percent as much vis as a wand with the same core, and gives an additional 10 percent discount for costs, beyond any discounts from its caps or the user's worn equipment. ANDpreRequ879Thaumcraft/ItemResource~15tasksANDretrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~273062rewardsitemThaumcraft/ItemResource~151Thaumcraft/ItemLootBag~11itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~05
