877Thaumcraft/WandCasting-4.png0Scepter With 75 Vis Capacity32-1A scepter is crafted from a wand core, a primal charm, three wand caps, a twilight forest monster mob drop, and some screws. Any sort of core or cap may be used, but the caps must match each other. A scepter cannot hold a focus, but holds 150 percent as much vis as a wand with the same core, and gives an additional 10 percent discount for costs, beyond any discounts from its caps or the user's worn equipment. ANDpre8790Thaumcraft/ItemResource-15.pngrewardsItemThaumcraft/ItemResource-15.pngPrimal Char;You think you hear whispering
