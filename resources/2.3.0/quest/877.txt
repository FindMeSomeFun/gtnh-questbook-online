877Scepter With 75 Vis CapacityA scepter is crafted from a wand core, a primal charm, three wand caps, a twilight forest monster mob drop, and some screws. Any sort of core or cap may be used, but the caps must match each other. A scepter cannot hold a focus, but holds 150 percent as much vis as a wand with the same core, and gives an additional 10 percent discount for costs, beyond any discounts from its caps or the user's worn equipment. ANDpreRequThaumcraft/ItemResource~15Quest Name For 879879rewardsItemThaumcraft/ItemResource~15Item Name1Thaumcraft/ItemLootBag~1Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalThaumcraft/ItemResource~15Thaumcraft/ItemResource~15 Name1Thaumcraft/WandRod~0Thaumcraft/WandRod~0 Name1dreamcraft/item.LichBone~0dreamcraft/item.LichBone~0 Name2gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~27306gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~27306 Name2
