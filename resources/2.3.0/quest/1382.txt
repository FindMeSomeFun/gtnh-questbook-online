1382Pimp Your Wand FocusThe Manipulator requires both XP levels and centi-vis in order to upgrade foci. Each Focus can be upgraded a total of five times, with the level and vis cost increasing by 8 for each upgrade. Some upgrades can be applied only at certain levels (often only at level 3), and others have prerequisite upgrades. Some upgrades like Frugal and Potency can be applied multiple times. All upgrades are permanent, and there is currently no way to remove them.ANDpreRequThaumcraft/blockStoneDevice~11Quest Name For 275275rewardsItemThaumcraft/ItemResource~15Item Name1Thaumcraft/ItemLootBag~1Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalThaumcraft/blockStoneDevice~13Thaumcraft/blockStoneDevice~13 Name1
