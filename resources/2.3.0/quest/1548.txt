1548Input chest for Ghetto ME SystemTo be able to put items into the Ghetto ME system you need just a few additional pipes.
The Extraction pipe should be connected to the chest you want to take items from.
Inside the Extraction pipe you need to put the Item Extraction chip, and configure it to blacklist if you want it to take all items from the chest.

The Routed Junction pipe is needed so the items inside the pipes know which direction to take, without this they will just fly around inside the pipes without knowing where to go.
You might also need some additional item transport pipes depending on your setup.ANDpreRequStorageDrawers/controller~0Quest Name For 739739rewardsChoiceProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.pipe~10Choice Name8enhancedlootbags/lootbag~4Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name15tasksANDRetrievalProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.pipe~1ProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.pipe~1 Name1ProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.pipe~2ProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.pipe~2 Name1RetrievalProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.routingchip~4ProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.routingchip~4 Name1
