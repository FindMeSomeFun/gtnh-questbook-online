3029gregtech/gt.blockmachines-32001.png0Universal Fuel Power21-1This is the most powerful combustion engine that has ever been built. In fact, it's not only that, but also a Gas Turbine and a Rocket Fuel Generator!

The Universal Chemical Fuel Engine burns fuel with some additives, as did its predecessors, but it runs at a lower efficiency. The 150% value is a mathematical limit, you cannot reach it without supplying infinite fuel, but this engine compensates by running as fast as fuel is input into it, without the maximum EU/t limitation the others had. The only two things you have to make sure of are that you supply enough Combustion Promoter to keep efficiency up (I'll let you figure the best ratio on your own, but 1:4 promoter:fuel is decent), and that the dynamo can support the EU/t that the generator is outputting.

§9§9§b§4You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest. You better burn enough HOG to make it worth!§r ANDpre30260witchery/brewgas-0.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines-32001.pngUniversal Chemical Fuel Engine;Machine Type: Chemical Engine;Controller block for the Chemical Engine;BURNING BURNING BURNING;Use combustible liquid to generate power.;You need to supply Combustion Promoter to keep it running.;This engine will consume all the fuel and combustion promoter in the hatch every second.;The efficiency is determined by the proportion of Combustion Promoter to fuel.;The proportion is bigger, and the efficiency will be higher.;It creates sqrt(Current Output Power) pollution every second;If you forget to supply Combustion Promoter, this engine will swallow all the fuel without outputting energy.;The efficiency is up to 150%.;The structure is too complex!;Follow the StructureLib hologram projector to build the main structure.;-----------------------------------------;Hold [LSHIFT] to display structure guidelines;Added by: Good Generator
