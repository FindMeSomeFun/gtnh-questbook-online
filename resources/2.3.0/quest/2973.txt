2973Let if flow, let it floww ...... can't hold it back anymore. It is time to collect the rewards of your hard work. Connect the fluid output hatch from the dam to the fluid input hatch of this turbine and finally enjoy the power! You can pause this multiblock if you cut the fluid input or use a machine controller. Oh, and you will get your water back in the fluid output hatch.

Congratulations to making it this far! Enjoy your ginormous energy buffer!
