Craft a flint GregTech knife with a stick and a piece of flint (it's hard to find in NEI, you need to search a bit) and I will give you an old iron one to use once it wears out.ANDpre101minecraft/porkchop-0.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metatool.01-34-Iron-Iron.pngKnife;Durability: 22,800 / 25,600;Iron lvl 2;Attack Damage: 2.0;Mining Speed: 3.0;Sharpness I
