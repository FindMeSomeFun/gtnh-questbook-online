gregtech/gt.metatool.01-34-Flint-Wood.png§1§lCows Are Supposed to Moo!What the? You noticed that sometimes when you kill something, even a cow or chicken, that it explodes! What madness! To stop it, use a proper GregTech Knife or Butchery Knife to kill them. Craft a flint GregTech knife with a stick and a piece of flint (it's hard to find in NEI, you need to search a bit) and I will give you an old iron one to use once it wears out.0-1ANDpre101minecraft/porkchop-0.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metatool.01-34-Iron-Iron.pngKnife\nDurability: 22,800 / 25,600\nIron lvl 2\nAttack Damage: 2.0\nMining Speed: 3.0\nSharpness I
