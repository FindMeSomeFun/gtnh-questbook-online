2763§6§lI Put a Machine Into Your MachineEffectively lets you parallel like crazy if you can afford the power. 1 EV hatch can supply all 64 possible machines if they're LV. You can also separate busses with a screwdriver. The PA is usually less efficient than a dedicated multiblock but it is very versatile and allows for TecTech energy hatches and even laser hatches once you get there.

§3Doesn't work with some machines, like mass fabs.

Just in case you get that far and still remember it: The PA maxes out at UHV recipes. But UEV machines are treated as 4x UHV machines giving you a lot of parallels.

There is also a new experimental feature where the PA can handle fluid recipes without cells but using the fluid directly.ANDpreRequ1225gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~327052149gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32597tasksANDretrievalgregtech/gt.blockcasings4~01rewards
