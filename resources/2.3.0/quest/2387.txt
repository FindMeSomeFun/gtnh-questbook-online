2387Mutating SprigThe Mutating Sprig brings a degree of order to the chaotic nature of Mutandis, allowing more limited, but also more predictable effects. It is a key tool in the creation of plant-based devices such as the Leech Chest.

The Mutating Sprig is crafted in the crafting bench using an Ent Twig, Nether Wart and Mutandis Extremis.
