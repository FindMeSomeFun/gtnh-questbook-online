2387Mutating SprigThe Mutating Sprig brings a degree of order to the chaotic nature of Mutandis, allowing more limited, but also more predictable effects. It is a key tool in the creation of plant-based devices such as the Leech Chest.

The Mutating Sprig is crafted in the crafting bench using an Ent Twig, Nether Wart and Mutandis Extremis.

You can buy wormwood from the Coins tab instead.ANDpreRequ2336witchery/ingredient~152338witchery/ingredient~82tasksANDretrievalwitchery/mutator~01rewardschoiceTwilightForest/tile.TFPlant~316enhancedlootbags/lootbag~521itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSurvivorI~05dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~05dreamcraft/item.CoinWitchI~05
