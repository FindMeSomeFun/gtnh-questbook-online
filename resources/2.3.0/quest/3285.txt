gregtech/gt.blockmachines-31150.pngMABSThis unholy union between Mega and GT++ must be the work of some madman. It is the ultimate metallurgical furnace to make your alloys with up to 256 parallels. If you pay very close attention you might even notice the almost imperceptable speed bonus from using expensive coils.

The glass tier limits both the energy hatch tier and the recipe tier. As with other multis, UEV glass unlocks all tiers and UV glass is needed for lasers.0-1ANDpre14161gregtech/gt.blockmachines-810.png26281gregtech/gt.blockmachines-48.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines-31150.pngMega Alloy Blast Smelter\nMachine Type: Fluid Alloy Cooker\nController block for the Mega Alloy Blast Smelter\nRuns the same recipes as the normal ABS, except with up to 256 parallels.\nEvery coil tier above cupronickel grants a speed bonus, based on this function:\nBonus = TIER / 150, rounded to the nearest thousandth.\nCan also use normal ABS coils in their place instead, if you don''t like the bonuses :)\nThe glass limits the tier of the energy hatch.
