2333§2§lHow to Open Your Wooden Doors?Wooden doors make your House safer. Let's craft some wooden Pressure plates and Buttons to open these Doors.

Doors will open when they receive a redstone signal, and close again after it stops. If you place the plates on either side of a door, it will open when you step on it. Or a monster does. Double doors will open together.

You'll need to use Oak for this quest. Purchase some saplings from the Coins tab if you don't have any nearby.

§3Pressure plates will send a RS when an entity is on top of them. There are different types, like items or not, or mobs/player/any entity/etc.

Buttons will emit one for about 2s before resetting.

Levers will emit a signal until switched back off. ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metatool.01~16Quest Name For 3636minecraft/wooden_door~0Quest Name For 17901790rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~1Choice Name1minecraft/wooden_door~0Choice Name1minecraft/wooden_button~0Choice Name8minecraft/wooden_pressure_plate~0Choice Name4Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSmith~0Item Name5dreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name5tasksANDOptionalminecraft/wooden_slab~0minecraft/wooden_slab~0 Name5gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~27809gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~27809 Name20gregtech/gt.metaitem.02~24032gregtech/gt.metaitem.02~24032 Name5Retrievalminecraft/wooden_pressure_plate~0minecraft/wooden_pressure_plate~0 Name10Retrievalminecraft/wooden_button~0minecraft/wooden_button~0 Name10
