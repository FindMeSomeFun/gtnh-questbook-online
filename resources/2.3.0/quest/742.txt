742§3§lOne Block Mining is so Old SchoolBy making a hammer you are now able to mine a shaft of 3x3 blocks. You can use iron, steel, or alumite poured from the Smeltery, it doesn't need to be steel. Higher tier metals require the MV extruder. You'll need a hammer head, two large plates and a large rod for your hammer.  Be careful in the Nether or you could be boiled in lava very quickly.
