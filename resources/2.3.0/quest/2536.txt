So you can shove that pollution producing Mega EBF in the Void where it belongs, but still use it from the safety of your main base. To create this, you'll need a Quantum Link Chamber surrounded by Quantum Rings. Then put an Quantum Entangled Singularity in the link chamber, and connect to one of the 4 Quantum Rings around it with a fluix cable. They cost 1000EU/t for each pair.

You can power the other side from the first, but you need to jumpstart it first, so bring an energy cell when setting it up. Remember that it's part of the same network, so you can only have one controller, and you're still limited by the channels of the cable you connected with, so you may wish to use the P2P Tunnel to bring more across.

If you use several, you may wish to rename the QESs.ANDpre25350appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial-47.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-38.pngLootBag\nYou feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...
