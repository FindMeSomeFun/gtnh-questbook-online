If you've accumulated them so much that they've started voiding, you can instead make an HV Semifluid Generator and get free power out of them!

The Creosote from one DT that is processing Wood Tar is enough to power the DT itself, depending on the fuel efficiency. One HV generator is just enough to power it.ANDpre811gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1002.png12311gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32652.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30741.pngHeavy Fuel Cell
