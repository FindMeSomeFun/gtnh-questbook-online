You can make lubricant out of oil, seed oil, fish oil or creosote in a distillery (or distillation tower later on). If you're able to craft a brewery you can use talc or soapstone to get much more lubricant each cycle.

Lube cells are required to make low tier energy hatches, so stockpile a few cells and use the rest to make your cutting machine faster.ORpre5471gregtech/gt.blockmachines-531.png12730gregtech/gt.blockmachines-491.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30713.pngSeed Oil Cell
