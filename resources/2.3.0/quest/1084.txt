1084§5§lLubricantUsing lubricant instead of water or distilled water in your cutting machines will increase their speed.

You can make lubricant out of oil, seed oil, fish oil or creosote in a distillery (or distillation tower later on). If you're able to craft a brewery you can use talc or soapstone to get much more lubricant each cycle.

Lube cells are required to make low tier energy hatches, so stockpile a few cells and use the rest to make your cutting machine faster.ORpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~531Quest Name For 547547gregtech/gt.blockmachines~491Quest Name For 12731273rewardsChoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30713Choice Name8enhancedlootbags/lootbag~4Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinChemist~0Item Name15tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30724gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30724 Name8
