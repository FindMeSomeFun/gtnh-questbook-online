88§5§r§5§lWelcome to Tier 1, LVWhy, hello there! It seems you've made it into the electrical age. Don't be so quick to throw away your steam machines, you'll probably want to keep using them for a while.

To make your life easier, you'll want to focus on getting a wiremill and bender first... once you suffer through making all the machine components.

After that, the polarizer, assembler, lathe, and chemical reactor+fluid solidifier (for rubber) all help make things cheaper.
