Collecting them yourself is a huge pain, and who wants to program robots? Plus servers. Fortunately, there's now a way to make seaweed.

The first thing you need is...Seaweed! Use that with Unknown Water you pumped from the same planet to make the culture. Expect this to take a while, as the chances are super low. You'll also need the max tier Bio Lab.

Once you have the culture you can make SeaweedBroth, by combining it with UnknownNutrientAgar and some other stuff. This can then be made into seaweed.ANDpre26571dreamcraft/item.TCetiESeaweedExtract-0.pngrewardstasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockmachines-12704.pngUV Bio La;The BioLab, a Multi-Use Bioengineering Station;Added by bartimaeusnek via BartWorks;Voltage IN: 524,288 (UV);Capacity: 33,554,432 EU
