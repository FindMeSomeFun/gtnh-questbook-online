1543Weed ExWeed-EX is used to prevent the growth of Weeds on empty Crop blocks at the cost of some weed-EX. Damage to the crop's quality is illusory, and not true. We have people that have looked at the code, we assure you. §oUnless§r it counts as a weed (venomilia Gr 8+, any other crop Gr 24+), then it loses maybe 1 stat. Maybe. And you can just increase it again too. And it might not take effect even then if you don't apply too much, like a crop matron won't.

Usage:
While holding Weed-Ex, right-click on a Crop to apply it. It can also be placed in a Crop-Matron to automatically apply it to your crops.AND1273gregtech/gt.blockmachines~4911542IC2/blockMachine2~2ANDretrievalIC2/itemWeedEx~032choiceminecraft/spider_eye~016gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~3240216enhancedlootbags/lootbag~291itemdreamcraft/item.CoinChemist~030dreamcraft/item.CoinFarmer~030enhancedlootbags/lootbag~514
