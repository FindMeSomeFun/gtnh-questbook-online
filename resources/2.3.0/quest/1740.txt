If you want to keep burning liquids, you need to build a better engine. This multiblock can produce 1A of EV voltage by default and 3A if you supply it with oxygen. However, this power doesn't come for free - you need to supply the machine with small amounts of lubricant constantly (and oxygen if you want to boost both its efficiency and output).

You will also require 3 Input Hatches, a Muffler, and a Dynamo Hatch. Their tiers are up to you.

Cetane Boosted Diesel and High Octane Gasoline (HOG) are excellent fuel sources for this engine.

You will need to keep the area in front of the engine clear so it can pull enough air - not even torches.ANDpre8601gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11028.png12451gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32653.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11028.pngTitanium Ingot;Ti
