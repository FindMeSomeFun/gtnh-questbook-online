2561§6§lBacterial VatThe Bacterial Vat is a unique multiblock machine with its own recipes. But it also has advanced versions of many brewery recipes.

The Vat isn't mandatory in this tier, but there are many useful recipes and you'll need it later on, so let's build one!

All recipes require a §cculture§r, some recipes require a specific §cGlass-Tier.

§rThe culture is made in a BioLab and §lput in the controller.

§l§rThe Glass-Tier is calculated as LV = Tier 1, so this quest requires you to make tier 3 glass.AND160gregtech/gt.blockmachines~132566gregtech/gt.blockmachines~12699ANDoptional_retrievalbartworks/BW_GlasBlocks~032retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~127121itemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~62itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~01
