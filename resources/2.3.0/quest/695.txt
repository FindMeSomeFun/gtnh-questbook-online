No problem, craft a large bronze pipe and place it under the faucet. Make sure to connect the pipe to the faucet using a wrench. Now the molten fluid will flow inside the pipe. Under or next to the pipe you have to place the casting basins or tables.

A hopper and a chest underneath will auto-output products from the casting blocks. 

NOTE: Faucets will output precisely 144L each activation if you toggle it off immediately. That's going to have some uses later on...ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~2300Quest Name For 3535TConstruct/Smeltery~0Quest Name For 7474rewardsItemTConstruct/GlassBlock~0Item Name16enhancedlootbags/lootbag~2Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name10tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~5123gregtech/gt.blockmachines~5123 Name1Optionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~17032gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~17032 Name10gregtech/gt.metaitem.02~31032gregtech/gt.metaitem.02~31032 Name2Optionalminecraft/chest~0minecraft/chest~0 Name4Retrievalminecraft/hopper~0minecraft/hopper~0 Name2
