No problem, craft a large bronze pipe and place it under the faucet. Make sure to connect the pipe to the faucet using a wrench. Now the molten fluid will flow inside the pipe. Under or next to the pipe you have to place the casting basins or tables.

A hopper and a chest underneath will auto-output products from the casting blocks. 

NOTE: Faucets will output precisely 144L each activation if you toggle it off immediately. That's going to have some uses later on...ANDpre351gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-2300.png740TConstruct/Smeltery-0.pngrewardsItemTConstruct/GlassBlock-0.pngClear Glass;Glass-Tier: HV
