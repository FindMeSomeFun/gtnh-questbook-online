No problem, craft a large bronze pipe and place it under the faucet. Make sure to connect the pipe to the faucet using a wrench. Now the molten fluid will flow inside the pipe. Under or next to the pipe you have to place the casting basins or tables.

A hopper and a chest underneath will auto-output products from the casting blocks. 

NOTE: Faucets will output precisely 144L each activation if you toggle it off immediately. That's going to have some uses later on...ANDpreRequ35gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~230074TConstruct/Smeltery~0tasksANDretrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~51231optional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.02~310322optional_retrievalminecraft/chest~04retrievalminecraft/hopper~02rewardsitemTConstruct/GlassBlock~016enhancedlootbags/lootbag~21itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~010
