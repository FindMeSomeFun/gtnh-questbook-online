3284IAADDSAka the Mega Apiary.

It has three primary modes (change with screwdriver) and two operation modes (change with shift+screwdriver):

INPUT MODE: Does not take power. Put your queens in the input bus to put them in the internal buffer.

OUTPUT MODE: Does not take power. Will give your bees back to the output bus.

OPERATING MODE - NORMAL: The processing time is 5 seconds. Uses 1 Amp LuV per queen. All bees are affected by 64x acceleration and 8 Production Upgrades as well as a Genetic Stabilizer Upgrade. The IAADDS also simulates a perfect environment for all bees.

You can provide royal jelly to increase the outputs. 1 royal jelly grants 5% bonus per bee. They will be consumed on each start of operation and be applied to that operation only. The maximum bonus is 200%.

OPERATING MODE - SWARMER: In this mode you can only insert 1 queen. The IAADDS will then slowly produce ignoble princesses for 100 royal jelly per operation. The base processing time is 1 minute but you can overclock this process. The base usage is 1 Amp IV.

ยง3Yes you need thousands of queens, not princesses.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~9399Quest Name For 20892089gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32657Quest Name For 26142614rewardsItemkubatech/kubaitems~2Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~14202gregtech/gt.blockmachines~14202 Name1
