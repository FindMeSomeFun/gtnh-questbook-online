Well, in that case, you better start collecting or making cobblestone, by the tens of thousands. And making explosives too.

Compress the cobblestone in an assembler first with circuit 1, then run them through the Implosion Compressor until you get Quadruple Compressed Cobblestone. Do that four times, and then another pass through the assembler with a diamond block, and there you have it - one bedrockium ingot.

Now do that 5 more times, and you can make yourself a bedrockium drum.

64k buckets of portable fluid. Perfect for your new Ore drill!

§3There's also a Bedrockium ore much later on if you're lazy. By then you probably won't want the drums though.ANDpre14740ExtraUtilities/drum-0.pngrewardsItemExtraUtilities/bedrockiumIngot-0.pngBedrockium Ingo
