That said, it is still a great source of some fluids, one of which being Ethylene, the precursor to Polyethylene, the first plastic that can be produced and a required part of progression in the pack. To obtain Ethylene from Oil, the best way to go is to severely steam-crack Refinery Gas.

Simply put the Refinery Gas and the Steam in a Chemical Reactor with the correct circuit (check NEI) and then distill the cracked Refinery Gas. It can give a lot of different outputs, so make sure you choose the right one. After doing this, you'll have successfully processed Oil, both for power and for byproducts.
