To make sure it only runs with UUA, put a programmed circuit (any value) in the machine's slot. UUMatter can be used for some very specific things, such as replicating §osome§r materials (check NEI, mostly/all periodic table), used with crops to create an ore, some specific high-level recipes need it, and...you can also sit in it to get regen.

The energy usage and overclocking of the Mass Fabricator is different than the usual GT way. To have fixed EU to UUM ratios for all tiers, the machine does perfect 2/2 overclocks. It also start with a very high amperage in LV. The following chart should make it more clear:

Tier  Amps       EU/t         Time
LV     8A         256          160
MV     4A         512           80
HV     2A        1024           40
EV     1A        2048           20
IV     0.5A      4096           10
etc.

Put in power (and hopefully UUA), and out comes UUM. You should also know that you can't use mass fabs or replicators with PAs.

For now, just stockpile the UU matter. You need data orbs to use the replicator, and that's explained next tier.
