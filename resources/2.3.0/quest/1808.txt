1808Plants That Make Their Own Fertilizer?Sign me up! This plant will create fertilzer ingredients for you. 

The best plants to cross to get Fertilia are zomplant, venomilia, trollplant, or spidernip. Watch out for venomilia though, not only is it poisonous, it also acts like a weed at growth 8+!

Use the IC2 fertilizer and apatite this drops to make forestry fertilizer if using the multifarm.

ยง3BTW this is the rarest one, with a 0.76% chance even for zomplant, so expect it to take approximately 3 eternities.ANDpreRequNatura/N Crops~0Quest Name For 721721rewardsItemIC2/itemFertilizer~0Item Name256tasksANDRetrievalIC2/itemCropSeed~0IC2/itemCropSeed~0 Name1
