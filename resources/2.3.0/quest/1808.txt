The best plants to cross to get Fertilia are zomplant, venomilia, trollplant, or spidernip. Watch out for venomilia though, not only is it poisonous, it also acts like a weed at growth 8+!

Use the IC2 fertilizer and apatite this drops to make forestry fertilizer if using the multifarm.

ยง3BTW this is the rarest one, with a 0.76% chance even for zomplant, so expect it to take approximately 3 eternities.ANDpre7210Natura/N Crops-0.pngrewardsItemIC2/itemFertilizer-0.pngFertilize
