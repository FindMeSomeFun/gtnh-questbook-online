It used to be the least useful fraction of oil, but it's now possible to distill it into large amounts of Ethylene if you steam-crack the Refinery Gas beforehand.

This early, you will have to use a Chemical Reactor to crack it, but later on there's a dedicated multiblock for this purpose, the Oil Cracker. For best Ethylene results, you should severely steam-crack it, and you will get lots of Methane as well.ANDpre5431gregtech/gt.blockmachines-421.png5501gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30001.png6420gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30734.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30715.pngMethane Cell;CH\u2084
