Aside from this, it's also required for Diesel, in MV, which is a better fuel, and it can also be distilled into three very useful fluids: Benzene, Toluene and Phenol.

It's honestly not especially efficient to make Heavy Fuel out of regular Oil. You should try to get Heavy Oil to make it, like from Oilsands Ore in MV once you can. Then use it to make Diesel.ANDpre5431gregtech/gt.blockmachines-421.png5501gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30001.png5510gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30738.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30707.pngOil Cell
