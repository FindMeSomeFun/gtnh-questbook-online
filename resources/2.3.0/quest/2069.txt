Your old gloves are falling apart, and take up both hands. I think there's a way to glue them together so you can carry hot items with just one hand. Give me some parts and I'll do it for you.

PS: The particle effect is active all the time, so if you don't like that, don't do this quest or don't wear them.ANDpre811gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1002.pngrewardsItemmiscutils/GTPP.bauble.fireprotection.0.name-0.pngSupreme Pizza Gloves
