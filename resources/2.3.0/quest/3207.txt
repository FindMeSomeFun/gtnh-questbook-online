appliedenergistics2/tile.BlockDenseEnergyCell-0-16000000.pngA Second Reactor?At this point, why not? You should be a in a better position to afford it, but there is the issue that t3 fusion unlocks an easier Americium recipe, which lets you craft a second t3 more easily. You might not want to wait that long, maybe you've been smelting a lot of ingots, or using World Accelerators?

Regardless, two Helium Plasma reactors will surely suffice for whatever it is you're doing. Tin Plasma is worth using, of course, but the Molecular Transformer recipe to convert Silver to Tin isn't available in the singleblock anymore, so you might want the easier option, since you're rocking two reactors and all. With the 2x overclock they're still produce millions of EU/t with the right Plasma Turbines, assuming you have them ready.0-1ORpre31870universalsingularities/universal.draconicEvolution.singularity-1.png31910dreamcraft/item.MedalWarp-0.pngrewardstasksANDCheckboxcheckbox-.pngCheckbox
