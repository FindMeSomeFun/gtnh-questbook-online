2027gregtech/gt.blockmachines-875.png0§6§lThermal Boiler - Lava you long time18-1If you want energy from Lava and the byproducts, the Thermal Boiler is the perfect solution. It processes Lava super fast for Steam, and with a Lava Filter will provide some centrifuged lava byproducts as well. A great source of Copper, Silver, Gold, Tin, Tantalum, and Tungstate, better outputs than regular lava processing in a Centrifuge.

You can get even better efficiency pairing it with a Large Heat Exchanger. The LHE will turn normal vanilla Lava into Pahoehoe Lava, which will provide Steam and byproducts in the Thermal Boiler. Win/Win/Win!
