1292appliedenergistics2/tile.BlockDrive-0.png1Storing Your ME Data27-1A block designed to do one thing, store storage cells. This block holds 10 storage cells so you can tightly pack your storage into a very small space. ME drives show their contents and the storage cell status on the front of the drive face.

Red - Indicates the storage cell is full.
Orange - Indicates the storage cell cannot hold any more types, but it can store more items.
Green - Indicates the cell can hold more types, or more items.
Black - Indicates there is no channel, or power is offline.

It's important to note, that without an ME Network this block does nothing. It's only useful when combined with a way to input, and output items, and requires 2 AE/t power to function, and additional power for each storage cell stored inside it.

About Priority: Many devices in AE2 have a priority setting, this determines what gets items first. This is useful in some situations, but not so much in others. Higher number = higher priority.ANDpre1831appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial-22.png1841appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiPart-16.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11085.pngPlatinum Ingot;Pt
