It's important to remember that Methane is used in several important chemical lines, such as PTFE and Silicone Rubber, but you'll get much more of it than you need for those purposes.

The Methane you get from one DT can power it 4 times. Using 1/4 of your power there, you can fuel the singleblock machines you're using, and the wood automation source as well if you feel like it. Regardless, this setup should fuel itself just fine.ORpre31160gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30677.png31210gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30691.pngrewardsItemminecraft/spawn_egg-92.pngSpawn Cow
