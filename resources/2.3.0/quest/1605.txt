1605Better Than MilkI haven't been feeling well lately. Would you grow me some Terrawart? They're better than milk, since they only remove negative effects, and stack to 64. Really nice when fighting that Alchemist infernal!

They also have Auramx8, Praecantatiox4 and Victusx4 essentia on them, very useful for the budding thaumaturge. And you can get them by placing a snow block under your netherwart and waiting instead of mutating to get them.ANDpreRequminecraft/reeds~0Quest Name For 16001600rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~51Item Name1dreamcraft/item.CoinFarmerI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalIC2/itemCropSeed~0IC2/itemCropSeed~0 Name1IC2/itemTerraWart~0IC2/itemTerraWart~0 Name16
