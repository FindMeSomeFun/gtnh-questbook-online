2770Min-Maxing CropsBreed stickreed until it's around 20/31/10, then create other crops with it, they inherit the stats. Crossbreeding with the ones you got on the way to raise their stats is also good.

Setup camp in a swamp/jungle type biome around Y130, or use the biome changing methods to make one. This is way faster when breeding crops, not just growing them for drops.

Use multifarms, always. You can use them together with the harvesters if you have super fast crops. Or just use more farms. Or add more gearboxes.

Dark glass is nice for oreberry crops.

To avoid weeding, checkerboard up and down on your multifarm. It may look stupid, but no weeds, Gr 23->31, and +2 AQ!

Use fertilia to create more fertilizer.

You can replace mob farms with crops if you don't care about the other drops. Infernals drop special stuff though.

Use WAs in TE mode to accelerate crops if you need it. Mostly useful for breeding, statting up, and for the primordial berry crop.

As you tier up, you can create 31/31/0 crops with the machines and UUM. It's up to you whether it's worth it though.

Go do bees if you want something higher than EV tier materials.ANDpreRequ2729gregtech/gt.blockmachines~12501tasksANDcheckboxgendustry/Waste~064rewards
