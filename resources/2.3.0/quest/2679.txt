miscutils/itemCellMutatedLivingSolder-0.pngOutsourcing the SolderingSoldering some of your new advanced materials is difficult. But maybe the new bio-technology you have developed can help? You should create a living solder that can do it for you! It will adjust to any challenge and join your materials at an atomic level filling all the gaps!

Use your Botmium Chemical Plant to make this Mutated Living Solder. The catalyst recipe requires infinity, so best upgrade your chemical plant to Tungstensteel Pipe Casings and at least Awakened Draconium Coils to remove the durability loss on the catalyst.1-1ANDpre26591gregtech/gt.metaitem.03-32076.png26751Avaritia/Resource-6.png26961miscutils/gtplusplus.blockspecialcasings.2-3.pngrewardstasksOROptionalmiscutils/itemCellMutatedLivingSolder-0.pngMutated Living Solder Cell\n?Sn?Bi?\nHold Ctrl to show additional info.
