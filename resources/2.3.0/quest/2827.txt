2827Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Mk IIt uses Gas fuels to produce power and Steam at the same time, while also generating 0 pollution. If the other generators were being problematic, this is the best solution.

It produces §a4 HV amps per tick§r at a nice fuel efficiency, while consuming 100 L of Oxygen per second. It will heat up over time until it reaches 100% efficiency, at which point it starts outputting Steam as well. You can then use Steam Turbines, singleblocks or multiblocks, to generate even more power.

With these two things combined, it's more powerful than the Large Gas Turbine that you can build at the start. Only when you unlock better materials for that, will it generate more power than the SOFC Mk I.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11028Quest Name For 860860gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32653Quest Name For 12451245rewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30686Item Name16enhancedlootbags/lootbag~7Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name5tasksANDOptionalkekztech/kekztech_yszceramicelectrolyteunit_block~0kekztech/kekztech_yszceramicelectrolyteunit_block~0 Name3IC2/blockAlloyGlass~0IC2/blockAlloyGlass~0 Name6gregtech/gt.blockcasings4~1gregtech/gt.blockcasings4~1 Name29gregtech/gt.blockmachines~90gregtech/gt.blockmachines~90 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~13101gregtech/gt.blockmachines~13101 Name1
