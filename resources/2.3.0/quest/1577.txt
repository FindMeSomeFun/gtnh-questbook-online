It can be collected and replanted, but will only spread if planted in the Spirit World, on Dirt or Grass that is next to a pool of Flowing Spirit.

Planting Wispy Cotton nearby when using a Brew of Sleeping near to a Dream Weaver of Nightmares will further reduce the chance of a nightmare by 10 percent for each cotton plant (up to 2).

Wispy Cotton will remain in a players inventory when they return from the Spirit World.
