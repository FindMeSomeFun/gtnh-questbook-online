It is the most advanced and LAG FREE crop farm that will allow you to supply the amount of tea you need.
The machine starts at EV, but to farm IC2 crops you will need at least LuV power.
To see the structure, place the controller on ground and use a structure hologram to build.
The glass tier limits the energy tier until UV. With UV glass you can have an energy tier as high as you want.
Shift click with screwdriver to change crop type (IC2/normal), sadly you can't farm both in one machine.
There are 3 modes to manage your crops (change with screwdriver):

Setup mode (input):
In this mode you can plant your crops in the machine.
Just put them in the input bus and enable the machine with a soft mallet.
Additionally, you need to insert block that is required for IC2 crop to grow (if any)
When the bus is empty, just disable it and change the mode.
Keep in mind that there is limited space of slots for your crops depending on the voltage.
With normal crops you start with 1 slot and that multiplies by 2 every tier past EV, every slot can take 64 crops of the same type.
With IC2 crops you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past LuV, every slot can take only 1 crop.

Setup mode (output):
This mode allows you to move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.
When the machine is running in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.

Normal operation:
With normal crops it is a straightforward process. Base processing time is 5 seconds, at the end of operation all crops are grown and the outputs are added to the output bus. Additionally the time is lower every tier past EV (The time is divided by the number of tiers past HV, minimum 1 second. WOW) 

IC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds. You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.

If you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer (up to 400% more drops !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input busses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation only. Each fetilizer gives +200% per crop in normal mode or +10% in IC2 mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops. Examples:
Normal mode, 3 wheat seeds, 1 tea seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150% wheat drops and +50% tea drops.
IC2 mode, 16 melon seed bags, you insert 64 fetilizer, you will get +40% drops.

Additionally, all your crops need water to grow. Every single crop drinks 1000L per operation. So for example if you have planted 576 tea seeds at UV voltage you will need 576000 L per second.

Last notes:
The animation canâ€™t be disabled.
The lamps can be inverted.
The dirt must be tilled.
If you encounter any issue or have any suggestion please open an issue on github and ping @kuba6000.
This MB was created to farm tea because I wanted to.
