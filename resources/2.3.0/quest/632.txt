632A Fisherman's FriendHave you ever tried to catch a fish with your bare hands? It's time to craft a fishing rod and get some fish the easy way. Cast your fishing rod in some water and wait until the bobber dips below the surface. Then reel back in your line and hopefully you caught yourself something nice.AND493gregtech/gt.metatool.01~26ANDoptional_retrievalminecraft/string~01craftingminecraft/fishing_rod~01choiceminecraft/fish~35harvestcraft/jellyfishrawItem~05harvestcraft/catfishrawItem~05enhancedlootbags/lootbag~281itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSurvivor~015dreamcraft/item.CoinFarmer~015
