1121Breed some imperial beesCross breeding noble and majestic bees can result in imperial bees.

These bees produce a Regeneration buff in their active area.  You can probably find a use for this in case of...accidents.

Imperial bees produce dripping combs every 3.8 minutes and royal jelly every 5.1 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time. 

Royal jelly is needed in making scented paneling for an Alveary - the third tier bee housing.
