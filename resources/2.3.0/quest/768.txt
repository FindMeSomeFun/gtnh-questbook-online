This way you can make industrial TNT, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene and other plastics more efficiently. You'll also need this for the platline.

You'll need to make EV circuits in a cleanroom to build this machine.

For hatches, you can choose your own tier. 1 MV energy does most of the useful recipes. 2 MV energy or 1 HV energy hatch will cover almost all the rest.

You will need 1 input hatch, and at least 5 output hatches. An output bus will capture any solid outputs.
