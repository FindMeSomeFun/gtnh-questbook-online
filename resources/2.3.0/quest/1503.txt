1. Don't cross chunk boundaries with the multiblock.

2. Don't rely on resources coming from outside the chunk to prevent explosions. In other words, make sure you source your water locally.

Also, if you haven't discovered it yet, Electric machines don't like getting rain or snow on them. They'll start fires, and those fires have a chance of causing an explosion. This explosion will explode other machines, cascading until your whole base is a hole in the ground. This is one of the reason backups are a thing. Stay safe out there!

Good luck.

§3BTW, there's also an Explosion.log file in the logs folder that tracks what caused an explosion if you're unsure. It appears to reset on world load though.ANDpre131minecraft/bed-0.pngrewardsItemminecraft/fireworks-0.pngFirework Rocket
