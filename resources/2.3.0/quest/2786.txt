2786How Many Forests Did You Cut Down to Power This?This is the HV version, with the lowest efficiency so far of 85%. You can offset that by just generating more Benzene, alongside Phenol and Toluene in a Distillation Tower, or use Naphtha instead... You have many options at this point, surely enough to fight the increasing power demands of your automation.

Benzene doesn't get upgraded in HV, only in EV. You'll be able to make Nitrobenzene when you're there, and burn it in some turbines bigger than this one.AND1231gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32652ANDretrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~11171itemmiscutils/nitrobenzene~08itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~01
