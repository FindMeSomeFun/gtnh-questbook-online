2948gregtech/gt.blockmachines-12732.png0Large Naquadah Reactor19-1The multi block version of the naquadah reactor, but it is completely different from the single block ones.

It uses liquid naquadah or excited nuclear liquid as fuel, and outputs the depleted fuel. You can see the liquid fuel infomation in NEI.

It consumes 2400 L/s liquid air when running, otherwise it will keep consuming your fuel without outputing power.

It will explode with more than one types of fuel in its hatches.

You can input in coolant to increase efficiency.
IC2 Coolant: 1.05x
Super Coolant: 1.5x
Cryotheum: 2.75x

You can also input molten metals to increase power.
Molten Caesium: 2x
Molten Uranium-235: 3x
Molten Naquadah: 4x
Molten Atomic Separation Catalyst: 16x
Note: It will consume more fuel to match the output power, unlike coolant which directly increases the power. The molten metal works like 'parallels' for your reactor.

It also supports TecTech's Multi-Amp Dynamo hatches and laser hatches.

PS: This generator has the highest output power in this pack currently, but it may get nerfed in future.ANDpre26221gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32676.pngrewardsItembartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedcell-10041.pngNaquadah Based Liquid Fuel MkII Cell
