When you have your inventory open, you can type the search terms in the text bar at the bottom. Make sure your GUI size is set correctly, or you won't be able to see it. Double-click the bar to highlight any matching items in your inventory or inventories you're looking at. Handy for searching for a specific ore, as they tend to look the same!

Even better, you can use T to search nearby inventories, which will emit some particles. 

We have also provided the special Y command to look for a machine in the world, in case you've forgotten where you placed that Advanced Circuit Assembler.

We now have an extra-fancy Bookmark feature! The default key is A, but can be changed in the NEI config window. Bookmarks will be on the left side of the inventory, and you can use R and U on the bookmarks to see the recipes or uses for that item, as normal.

Pushing O will hide NEI, useful for fancy screenshots.1-1ANDpre151SpiceOfLife/lunchbag-0.pngrewardsItemdreamcraft/item.CoinAdventure-0.pngCoin "The Explorer 1"
