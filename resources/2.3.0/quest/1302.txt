1302Interfacing with MachinesThe ME Interface is the only component which can be used as a part, or as a Block. Crafting an ME interface in either form by itself produces the other form. The thin form is useful if you want to provide several different interfaces in a single block of physical space, but each will need its own channel. The block form lets multiple other blocks connect to a single ME interface, using only one channel for the interface. The ME Interface acts as an in between when working with pipes, tubes, networks, or machines from other mods.
