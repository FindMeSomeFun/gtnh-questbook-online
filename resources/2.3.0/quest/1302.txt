1302Interfacing with MachinesThe ME Interface is the only component which can be used as a part, or as a Block. Crafting an ME interface in either form by itself produces the other form. The thin form is useful if you want to provide several different interfaces in a single block of physical space, but each will need its own channel. The block form lets multiple other blocks connect to a single ME interface, using only one channel for the interface. The ME Interface acts as an in between when working with pipes, tubes, networks, or machines from other mods.

ยง3If you're using a resource pack and the interface's GUI doesn't show up properly, you'll need to delete the assets\appliedenergistics2\textures\guis\interface.png file in your resourcepack zip file.AND1301appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial~44ANDretrievalappliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiPart~4404choiceappliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial~221appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial~241appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial~231enhancedlootbags/lootbag~371itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~01
