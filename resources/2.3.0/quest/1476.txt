gregtech/gt.metatool.01-36-Iron-Iron.png§2§lAll the Finest Cuts of MeatThis knife is not going to work for slaughtering the hundreds of animals you will need for food and materials. Make yourself a GregTech Butchery Knife. It stops the explosions, and kills the cows much faster, not to mention has Looting on it. Later when you get Stainless Steel, you can make a new one that will kill cows in one hit.
