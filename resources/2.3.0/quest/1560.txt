According to legend, when the root of the Mandrake plant is dug up it screams and kills all who hear it. This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.

Breaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).

Belladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant. The fully grown belladonna plant can be harvested to obtain more Belladonna seeds and a Belladonna flower.

Snowbell seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage snowbell plant. The fully grown snowbell plant can be harvested to obtain more Snowbell seeds, snowballs and occasionally a Icy Needle.

Water Artichoke seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Water Artichoke plant. The fully grown Water Artichoke plant can be harvested to obtain more Water Artichoke seeds and a Water Artichoke Globe.

Water Artichoke seeds can only be planted on water source blocks.

Garlic is a plantable crop that can be used to make tasty food, and to deal with vampires. Garlic can be obtained by breaking tall grass, although it has a very low drop chance. It may be planted on tilled farm land, and will grow in five stages. When full grown the plant may be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.

Garlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.

Wolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant. The fully grown Wolfsbane plant can be harvested to obtain more Wolfsbane seeds and the Wolfsbane flower.
