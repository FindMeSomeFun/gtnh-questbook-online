Put a WIU in a transfer node attached to a crafting table. On the other side of the table, the 3x3 area is now treated as a crafting grid.  Place items in inventories on the other side and if they make a valid recipe, the WIU will craft it.  To speed it up, you will need to wait until HV for stainless steel.

Also, if you place a node on a block of cobble that has lava and water next to it, and a WIU in it, it will produce cobble for you automatically. Use upgrades to get more at a time and faster.
