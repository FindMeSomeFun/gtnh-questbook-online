2189SpectralSpectral bees will require Ender bees to breed.  This will test the ability of even the toughest beekeeper - don't forget your apiarist suit. To work in a bee housing, there must be a Dragon Egg nearby. Don't drop any bones, blazerods or rotten meat! This bee will cause those to come back to life! Perhaps you can find a use for this ability. Breed them from Ender and Hermitic. ANDpreRequForestry/beePrincessGE~0Quest Name For 21752175rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~26Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalForestry/beePrincessGE~0Forestry/beePrincessGE~0 Name1
