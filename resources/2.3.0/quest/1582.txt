1582Hunger No More!The Dream Weaver of Fasting will add a boost to the saturation of a player when they wake up from a good nights sleep, essentially meaning they will not get hungry for the duration of the effect. If the dream weaver is corrupted by a nearby Dream Weaver of Nightmares, the weaver will instead add a hunger effect to the player.AND1583witchery/ingredient~103ANDoptional_retrievalwitchery/ingredient~291retrievalwitchery/ingredient~51itemwitchery/somniancotton~04witchery/ingredient~994enhancedlootbags/lootbag~541itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSurvivorII~01dreamcraft/item.CoinWitchII~01dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardII~01
