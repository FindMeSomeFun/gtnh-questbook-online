Click on an item to see the recipe to create it, and press Backspace to go back to the previous recipe. 

Hold Shift to stop the oredict cycling through items, and to show the oredict entries for the current item under your cursor.

Search using #oredict to find items that match that oredict; for example, #dyewhite will list all white dyes.

Use * (asterisk) as a wildcard. For example #pipe*bronze will show you bronze pipes of all sizes.

Search using @mod. to find all items from that mod; for example, @mod.thaumcraft will list all thaumcraft items and blocks. Note that you need the whole name before it works.

You can even search a subset now with the right text. @mod.thaumcraft->table will search for anything with table in the name, in the mod thaumcraft. 

@thaumcraft and @thaumcraft-> will also search for anything from the mod thaumcraft, but only if the name is set correctly on the tooltip of the item. They basically always are though.

It has even more advanced features than mentioned here, you should check the web for details. Or just play around with the options.ANDpreRequ1505minecraft/bookshelf~0tasksANDcheckboxdreamcraft/item.CoinAdventure~01rewardsitemdreamcraft/item.CoinSmith~01
