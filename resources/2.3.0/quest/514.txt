In the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Genetics is used for bees, trees, and Botany flowers so it gets its own quest tab. Gendustry is really good for bees, but will require top tier equipment.ANDpre2131gregtech/gt.blockmachines-15.png5070Forestry/apiculture-0.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-25.pngLootBag;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
