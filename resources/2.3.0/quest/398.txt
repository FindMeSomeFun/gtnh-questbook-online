witchery/babashat-0.pngKill Baba YagaBaba Yaga is a witch (or one of a trio of sisters of the same name), who appears as a deformed and/or ferocious-looking elderly woman. She flies around in a mortar and wields a pestle. She dwells deep in the forest, in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs, with a fence decorated with human skulls. Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter or seek her out.0-1ANDpre15710witchery/distilleryidle-0.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-55-enchanted.pngLootBag\nYour luck is increased by 100 %\nFortune III
