2532Alpha and OmegaThe ME Annihilation Plane destroys blocks as if you had mined them, and places them into the network. The Identity version acts as if silk touch was used.

This can work in both block and item mode.AND1301appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial~44ANDretrievalappliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiPart~3201itemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~381itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~02
