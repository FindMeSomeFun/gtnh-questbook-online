161Paying the Highest PriceWhen regular magic just isn't enough, you need something... stronger. Which is paid with blood. Your blood, and maybe others'.

In tier 1 you only need to place the blood altar. Plan for the configuration to grow in size up to 23x23 for a single altar.

Keep in mind that you get less blood, and use more when crafting in GTNH. Plan for pain and frustration too.

The altar has a 10,000L blood tank, plus a 1,000L I/O buffer (you can pump in and out, but the rate is pitifully low at the start). Blood will flow to the I/O buffer until it's full, so be aware of that before your first craft.ANDpreRequThaumcraft/blockCosmeticSolid~7Quest Name For 239239Thaumcraft/blockStoneDevice~0Quest Name For 240240Thaumcraft/blockMetalDevice~0Quest Name For 241241witchery/ingredient~10Quest Name For 15681568rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~16Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinBloodII~0Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalAWWayofTime/Altar~0AWWayofTime/Altar~0 Name1
