161AWWayofTime/Altar-0.png1Paying the Highest Price37-1When regular magic just isn't enough, you need something... stronger. Which is paid with blood. Your blood, and maybe others'.

In tier 1 you only need to place the blood altar. Plan for the configuration to grow in size up to 23x23 for a single altar.

Keep in mind that you get less blood, and use more when crafting in GTNH. Plan for pain and frustration too.

The altar has a 10,000L blood tank, plus a 1,000L I/O buffer (you can pump in and out, but the rate is pitifully low at the start). Blood will flow to the I/O buffer until it's full, so be aware of that before your first craft.ANDpre2391Thaumcraft/blockCosmeticSolid-7.png2401Thaumcraft/blockStoneDevice-0.png2411Thaumcraft/blockMetalDevice-0.png15680witchery/ingredient-10.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-16.pngLootBag (BM Novice;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
