But they're quite cheap, and a good solution to building compact machine setups. They include a free simple item filter which can be enabled on the input or output side. And they support multiple inputs and outputs! Glowstone will make it transfer faster - try investigating other upgrades.ANDpre11481gregtech/gt.blockmachines-12.pngrewardsItemTranslocator/diamondNugget-0.pngDiamond Nugget
