153§6§lSimple Item TransferTranslocators can only transfer items over a distance of 1 block. But they're quite cheap, and a good solution to building compact machine setups. They include a free simple item filter which can be enabled on the input or output side. And they support multiple inputs and outputs! Glowstone will make it transfer faster - try investigating other upgrades.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~12Quest Name For 11481148rewardsItemTranslocator/diamondNugget~0Item Name2enhancedlootbags/lootbag~5Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name25tasksANDRetrievalTranslocator/translocator~0Translocator/translocator~0 Name1
