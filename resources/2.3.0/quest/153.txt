153§6§lSimple Item TransferTranslocators can only transfer items over a distance of 1 block. But they're quite cheap, and a good solution to building compact machine setups. They include a free simple item filter which can be enabled on the input or output side. And they support multiple inputs and outputs! Glowstone will make it transfer faster - try investigating other upgrades.AND1148gregtech/gt.blockmachines~12ANDretrievalTranslocator/translocator~01itemTranslocator/diamondNugget~02enhancedlootbags/lootbag~51itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~025
