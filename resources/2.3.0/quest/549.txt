The remaining Hydrogen Sulfide can be used to produce Sulfuric Acid for, well, tons of stuff. You can never have enough of it! You can also crack Light Fuel in a Chemical Reactor and then distill it to get Ethylene, for Polyethylene. But Refinery Gas is better for that.ANDpre5431gregtech/gt.blockmachines-421.png5480gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30737.png5501gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30001.pngrewardsChoiceirontank/obsidianTank-0.pngObsidian Tank;Glass-Tier: HV;Stores up to 64 Buckets of one Liquid Not portable, use a dolly (Blast Proof)
