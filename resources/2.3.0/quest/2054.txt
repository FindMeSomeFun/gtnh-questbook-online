gregtech/gt.blockmachines-876.pngPutting all those workers out of jobsThe large scale auto-assembler will put things together for you, in volume. It is designed to be an Assembler, Disassembler, and Autocrafter all in one. However, at the moment only the assembler is usable. This multi is available in ZPM. 

ยง3While it unlocks much later, has much fewer parallels, and has no TT energy hatch support in contrast to the Precise Assembler, it has one upside: If you use two energy hatches you can craft items of the next tier.0-1ANDpre14161gregtech/gt.blockmachines-810.png26101gregtech/gt.blockmachines-17.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-8.pngLootBag\nYou feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...\nEnchant with a Fortune III Book
