2364Transference GemThe Transference Gem is used to teleport to a marked location.

The Transference Gem uses Energy and can be charged in an Energy Extraction Table.ยง3 (?)ยงr Shift+right-clicking on a block with a Transference Gem in hand will link the gem to that block. 
The state of the gem itself will switch to "Linked", as seen in its tooltip. 
After linking, the player can right-click with a Transference Gem in hand to teleport to the linked block, using some of the Energy stored in the gem.

Using F3+H to enable detailed item tooltips makes the Transference Gem show the exact coordinates and the dimension of the linked location.

Once the charge of the Transference Gem becomes lower than 44%, negative effects will appear:

Deflection - the player will be teleported to a random location instead of the linked block.
Various negative potion effects, the lower the charge is - the longer they will last:

Slowness II
Nausea I
Weakness II
Hunger I

Endermen - Angry Endermen will spawn and attack the player.
Item drop - a random amount of items in player's inventory will drop to the ground.
Storm - will cause a 2-3 minute storm. This is the most rare effect.ANDpreRequ2363HardcoreEnderExpansion/spatial_dash_gem~0tasksANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.98~46retrievalHardcoreEnderExpansion/transference_gem~01rewardschoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.98~464HardcoreEnderExpansion/essence~032HardcoreEnderExpansion/endoplasm~016HardcoreEnderExpansion/arcane_shard~016HardcoreEnderExpansion/end_powder~064enhancedlootbags/lootbag~581itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSmithII~02dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardII~02HardcoreEnderExpansion/knowledge_note~04
