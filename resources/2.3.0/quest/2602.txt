You'll need to slice the circuits for the imprint in either a tier-appropriate slicing machine, or the Cutting Factory in slicing mode.

To use the imprints, place them in the CAL controller's item slot. The CAL will be imprinted once you turn it on. You can see what it's imprinted with by using a portable scanner on the controller. You can also swap out controllers if you're too lazy to make more CALs.

§3If you already have an imprint for an earlier version of a recipe, you don't need to make another, it works with both recipes.

§4Because of the way oredicting and recipes work, slicing LV or HV circuits in the Cutting Factory will not work properly, so use at least an HV slicing machine for those.ANDpre26061bartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedItem0-3.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalbartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedgemExquisite-35.pngExquisite Prasiolite;Si\u2085O\u2081\u2080Fe;Added by BartWorks
