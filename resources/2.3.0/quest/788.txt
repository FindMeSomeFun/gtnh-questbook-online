788§6§lEven More Steam? Are You Sure?The Large Tungstensteel Boiler is the biggest and baddest of the four. Like the Titanium one, it is a specialized boiler that only accepts specific fuels, mainly the Solid Super Fuels, but it will produce Superheated Steam at a rate equivalent to 16000 EU/t, at 100% fuel efficiency. If you have good Steam Turbines, especially Oriharukon ones, you will get much more power than that, around 24000 EU/t or more.

Depending on how many of these you build, you might need a huge amount of turbines. To solve that problem, consider going a bit above the optimal flow on each turbine, or even switching to Loose mode, although this is only a good choice if you can match the optimal flow in that mode.ANDpreRequGalacticraftMars/item.spaceshipTier2~0Quest Name For 186186rewardsItemgregtech/gt.blockreinforced~7Item Name64enhancedlootbags/lootbag~7Item Name2Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianIII~0Item Name1tasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockcasings3~15gregtech/gt.blockcasings3~15 Name3gregtech/gt.blockcasings2~15gregtech/gt.blockcasings2~15 Name3gregtech/gt.blockcasings4~0gregtech/gt.blockcasings4~0 Name32Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~1023gregtech/gt.blockmachines~1023 Name1
