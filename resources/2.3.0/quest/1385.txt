§4Please use responsibly, and don't move things you shouldn't, like door halves, or some multiblock parts, unless you like the idea of world corruption destroying your world. That said, if you've backed up and play SP, do whatever, so long as you don't complain to us about it.§r §4§r

§4Moving Nodes can cause massive Flux explosions so handle with care.§r

It uses:
