These require the original block directly beneath them to grow properly.

There is also a Grey stonelilly for stone dust (who needs more of that??) and a Yellow stonelilly for sand or Endstone dust. Handy for the clever chemist!ANDpre16070gregtech/gt.metatool.01-40.pngrewardsItemIC2/itemCropSeed-0.pngYellow Stonelilly Seeds\nGr 1\nGa 1\nRe 1
