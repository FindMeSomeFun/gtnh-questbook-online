1805StonelilliesStone lillies allow you to get dusts without having to look for granites, basalt, or marble. A great renewable way to get calcite, fluorine, or bulk aluminium (and a tiny bit of uranium).

These require the original block directly beneath them to grow properly.

There is also a Grey stonelilly for stone dust (who needs more of that??) and a Yellow stonelilly for sand or Endstone dust. Handy for the clever chemist!ANDpreRequ1607gregtech/gt.metatool.01~40tasksANDretrievalIC2/itemCropSeed~01rewardsitemIC2/itemCropSeed~01enhancedlootbags/lootbag~511
