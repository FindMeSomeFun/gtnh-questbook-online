dreamcraft/item.TCetiESeaweedExtract-0.pngIt's Not Going Bad, I Swear!To make your next tier of circuits (Bio Circuits), you need to make Raw Bio Medium. There are three ways of making it.

The first one requires Stemcells, Unknown Crystal and T-Ceti Seaweed Extract at LuV voltage and 94 Sievert (Plutonium level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 4:1 ratio.

The second one is basically the first one, but it requires Infinity Catalyst instead of Tritanium at ZPM voltage and 140 Sievert (Enriched Naquadah level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 1:1 ratio.

The third one is the most efficient, but it requires Biocells (which you don't have yet), and 4 dust of Infinity Catalyst at UV voltage and 150 Sievert (Naquadria level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 1:2 ratio.

ยง3The second and third ways use a different culture.1-1ANDpre26481GalaxySpace/item.Tier8Rocket-0.pngrewardstasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30608.pngRaw Growth Catalyst Medium Cell
