839§5§6§l§5§lHandle Tiny Piles Like a K1ngDon't you hate having to manually compress all those tiny piles? Well, let me show you how to automate that. A combination of type filter, chest buffer (or super buffer in HV) and packager frees you from that annoying task. The chestbuffer can hold up to 9 stacks of tiny piles and the super buffer can hold 256 stacks of tiny dusts, which is more than enough. You can set its mode with a screwdriver on the output side. Set it to 9 to export 9 tiny piles at a time and let the packager compress these into regular dusts.

Super buffers can be lag sources, so be careful to keep them as empty as possible. If you're using a multiblock packager, be sure to change the buffer from Stocking mode to Transfer Size mode.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32650Quest Name For 9292rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~4Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name25tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~9251gregtech/gt.blockmachines~9251 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~9231gregtech/gt.blockmachines~9231 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~401gregtech/gt.blockmachines~401 Name1
