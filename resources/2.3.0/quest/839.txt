A combination of type filter, chest buffer (or super buffer in HV) and packager frees you from that annoying task. The chestbuffer can hold up to 9 stacks of tiny piles and the super buffer can hold 256 stacks of tiny dusts, which is more than enough. You can set its mode with a screwdriver on the output side. Set it to 9 to export 9 tiny piles at a time and let the packager compress these into regular dusts.

Super buffers can be lag sources, so be careful to keep them as empty as possible. If you're using a multiblock packager, be sure to change the buffer from Stocking mode to Transfer Size mode.ANDpre921gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32650.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.blockmachines-5603.pngLarge Brass Item Pipe;Item Capacity: 2 Stacks/sec;Routing Value: 16,384
