650Copterpack, More 'Hover' than 'Jet'The copterpack is the first jetpack with a hover mode. It uses several different types of fuels to power it. 

Buckets of creosote, lava, oil, diesel, cetane, ethanol, and fuel will work.

Equip your jetpack and hit Shift and the adventure backpack's action-key. You can also switch between hover and normal mode.

Max flying height is limited to Y-200. 

Vertical velocity decreases linearly with height after overcoming optimal height - 135 for jetpack and 100 for copter.
