2033gregtech/gt.blockmachines-860.png0A 9 in 1 machine, what a steal!18-1This machine has 3 modes, capable of emulating 9 of the less common machines.

The 3 general modes are cycled by using a screwdriver on the controller. Each of the modes can support 3 different machines selected by putting a circuit into the same input bus as the items you want to process. If you have a look at the description of the controller in NEI, you will see a list of the supported machines for each mode. These are in order and can be used with circuit numbers 20, 21 and 22. This also means that you can use multiple input busses with different circuits to use the full potential of the machine. You can also use more busses to use different non-consumable items in the recipes. You can only fluid solidify one shape per machine though.
