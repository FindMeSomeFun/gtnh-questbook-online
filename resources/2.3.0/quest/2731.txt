Unfortunately, it's kinda expensive. On the other hand, you can use it to turn your lasers from your laser hatches, which is probably a better use.

It doesn't need a Maintenance Hatch, just the I/O Hatches.

Be sure to turn off Power Pass if you want to edit your machine and don't want it to explode!ANDpre20061tectech/gt.blockcasingsTT-0.pngrewardstasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockcasings-15.pngSuperconducting Coil Block
