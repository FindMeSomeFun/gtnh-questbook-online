2731Transform and...Stay Put ActuallyActive Transformers will transform power up or down at only a 0.004% power loss, making using several in a row obsolete, if you can afford it. Unfortunately, it's kinda expensive. On the other hand, you can use it to turn your lasers from your laser hatches, which is probably a better use.

It doesn't need a Maintenance Hatch, just the I/O Hatches.

ยง4Be sure to turn off Power Pass if you want to edit your machine and don't want it to explode!ANDpreRequtectech/gt.blockcasingsTT~0Quest Name For 20062006rewardstasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockcasings~15gregtech/gt.blockcasings~15 Name1tectech/gt.blockcasingsTT~0tectech/gt.blockcasingsTT~0 Name23Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~15300gregtech/gt.blockmachines~15300 Name1
