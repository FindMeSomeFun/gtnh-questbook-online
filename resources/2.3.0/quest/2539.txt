The Redstone Card adds redstone interactivity to the devices it can be used on, with the following options:
Always active, active with or without redstone signal, activate once per pulse.

The Capacity Card adds more slots for items that use them. If you add this to an Export Bus, an icon is added to select item priority.

The Crafting Card allows you to automatically request autocrafting of items.
In an ME Interface, if you put in items to be stocked, if there aren't enough, it'll craft them until it reaches the selected amount. Remember that these are being stocked for crafting recipes that the ME Interface has. If you want them to be seen by the network, you'll need to put a storage bus on the ME Interface.

In an ME Level Emitter, in the first mode, it'll emit a redstone signal while the specific item is being crafted. In the second, it will emit a redstone signal once a crafting job for the item has been requested, but it won't send the items to be crafted. This is useful if you're using a dummy pattern, and are using the level emitter to tell something else to happen. You still need to get the item(s) requested back into the system so it doesn't tie up a crafting CPU though.

In an ME Export Bus, it'll attempt to send whatever item(s) are selected in the export bus' GUI. In the first mode, it'll send available items first, then create crafting jobs for the rest. In the second mode, it will only send crafted items.

The Acceleration Card makes the device/fixture work faster. You'll probably want a lot of these.

The Inverter Card allows you to invert the item filter of certain fixtures.

The Fuzzy Card allows you to apply fuzzy logic to filtering to allow items with different NBT or damage data to be counted as the same. This is different from metadata. If you just want it to be fuzzy for nbt, set to Match Any. If it is set to 99%, it will work on anything that is damaged. You can use the Inverter Card to reverse this.ANDpre1831appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial-22.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-37.pngLootBag (AE Basic);You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...
