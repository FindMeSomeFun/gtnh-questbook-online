IC2/itemCellEmpty-1.png§5§lMachine Interface Fluid I/OThanks to the tireless work of the devs, you can now use cells to I/O fluids directly from the interface of GT machines. Just click on the fluid while holding a cell or other fluid container item.

Points to consider:
1) Left click to attempt filling/emptying all fluid containers held on cursor.
2) Right click to attempt filling/emptying one fluid container held on cursor.
3) All fluid containers that can be used in a standard gt tank (e.g. super tanks or the X voltage tanks) are supported, including but not limited to: water bottles, vanilla buckets, ic2 (universal and normal) cells, volumetric flasks, large fluid cells, pressurized fluid tanks, etc.
4) Can fill/take less than one cell (1000L or 144L if molten) of fluid if the fluid container supports doing so.
5) It won't check if it's a valid fluid for the machine/recipe, keep that in mind.
6) Doesn't work with Crops++ alcohols, feel free to code compatibility for us.
7) EIO tanks need to be placed and picked up first before they can be used.0-1ANDpre881gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1120.pngrewardstasksANDCheckboxcheckbox-.pngCheckbox
