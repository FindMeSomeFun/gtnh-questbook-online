You'll need to either use the Implosion Compressor or Precision Laser Engraver to up the quality to Exquisite. You'll also need the dust version as well, so don't convert them all.

For the amount of Amethyst you'll need, you'll want to make a stop on Venus.

If you have a T5 rocket, you can get the ore from Ross128ba directly and run it through the sifter.ANDpre26001dreamcraft/item.OvenGlove-0.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalbartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedgemExquisite-35.pngExquisite Prasiolite\nSi\u2085O\u2081\u2080Fe\nAdded by BartWorks
