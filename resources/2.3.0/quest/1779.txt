1779Step AssistantThe Piston Boots are a bouncy pair of shoes for adventurers.

It functions as a piece of armor for the foot slot that gives a fun jump boost! They let the wearer jump up to THREE blocks in height and increase run speed. They also grant a Step Up enchantment to allow the wearer to step up a single block without jumping while sprinting. You can repair them with leather using an anvil.

Basically, make them ASAP.ANDpreRequ49minecraft/piston~0486Backpack/tannedLeather~0tasksANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~273001retrievaladventurebackpack/pistonBoots~01rewardschoiceBackpack/tannedLeather~02minecraft/piston~02gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~178802gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~113004enhancedlootbags/lootbag~21itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSmith~010dreamcraft/item.CoinSurvivor~010
