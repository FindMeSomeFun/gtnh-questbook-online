2084Collecting the HybridsIf you got lucky and found some bees in a village, put them in their houses next to some trees. Over time the bees will slowly pollinate the leaves of the trees. Using a grafter you can break the leaf blocks to retrieve a sapling 100%, useful for getting the forestry saplings. This doesn't seem to work with magical trees though. You can trade with villagers to get proven grafters that have a longer lifetime. Also investigate magic, you have heard rumors of long lasting grafters available to magicians. 

GregTech also offers a really nice tool, the Branch Cutter.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~2300Quest Name For 3535rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~19Item Name1Forestry/grafterProven~0Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinForestry~0Item Name15tasksANDRetrievalForestry/grafter~0Forestry/grafter~0 Name1
