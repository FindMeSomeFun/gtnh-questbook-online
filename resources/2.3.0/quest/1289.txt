1289§9§lHV BenderAn HV Bender is 4x faster than your LV Bender, but it also opens up an important recipe - Tin Cans!  

With this bender you can turn Tin Casings into Tin Cans. Using the Tin Cans with food in a Canner will make Canned Food. This can stack up to 64, and will fully restore your shanks - no need to rotate food types any more! You will eat as much as you need with one click. One drawback is you will no longer get the Well Fed buff with its slight health regen bonus, nor will you gain more hearts from eating new food. Also, these cans don't fit in the lunch bag or lunch box so you don't need those any more.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32652Quest Name For 12311231rewardsItemIC2/itemTinCanFilled~0Item Name2Itemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~6Item Name1dreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~223gregtech/gt.blockmachines~223 Name1
