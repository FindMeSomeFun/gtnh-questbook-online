The only downside is that iron furnaces can be used in the EBF later on. Nether furnaces cannot.  Then again, Nether dust is practically free, so what's the loss? You can always use them to bake stacks of bread!ANDpre4791minecraft/portal-0.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-2.pngLootBag (Steam Age);You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
