1908§3§lLucifer's Little HelperWith an alloy smelter and some netherrack dust you can make Nether furnaces, which are extremely efficient cooking machines. Very handy for someone needing a lot stuff furnaced in a jiffy.

The only downside is that iron furnaces can be used in the EBF later on. Nether furnaces cannot.  Then again, Nether dust is practically free, so what's the loss? You can always use them to bake stacks of bread!ANDpreRequminecraft/portal~0Quest Name For 479479rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~2Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinAdventure~0Item Name10tasksANDRetrievalNatura/NetherFurnace~0Natura/NetherFurnace~0 Name1
