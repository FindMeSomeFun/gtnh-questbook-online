2461'Easy' TeleportationThey may be a pain to craft, but teleposers are very useful for teleporting. Use the Teleposition Focus to set the first Teleposer location and put it in the second. Apply a redstone signal, and it'll teleport you at the cost of LP. It can also move items or entities, with the size increasing with better foci.ANDpreRequ708AWWayofTime/masterBloodOrb~0tasksANDretrievalAWWayofTime/blockTeleposer~02rewardsitemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~171itemdreamcraft/item.CoinBloodII~03
