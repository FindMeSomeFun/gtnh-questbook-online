Use the Teleposition Focus to set the first Teleposer location and put it in the second. Apply a redstone signal, and it'll teleport you at the cost of LP. It can also move items or entities, with the size increasing with better foci.0-1ANDpre7081AWWayofTime/masterBloodOrb-0.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-17.pngLootBag\nYou feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...\nEnchant with a Fortune III Book
