witchery/ingredient-5.pngMore Power Now!The Dream Weaver of Intensity has two effects, firstly it will add a very short night vision effect (or blindness if corrupted by a nightmare) to a player when they wake up from a good nights sleep. Secondly, it will intensify all other nearby dream weavers so that they have either a stronger (but shorter lasting) effect or their duration is increased.0-1ANDpre15840witchery/ingredient-96.pngrewardsItemwitchery/somniancotton-0.pngWispy Cotton
