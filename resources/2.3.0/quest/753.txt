It takes 85 seconds at 480 EU/t or 60 seconds at 480 EU/t by adding Oxygen gas. Always add a gas if you can, you're saving tons of power by doing so, and you're gonna need a TON of SS. The Cracker, Large Steam Turbine, and Distillery Tower all need huge amounts of SS. A single DT uses several stacks, and you're gonna want more than just one.ORpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~2306Quest Name For 749749gregtech/gt.blockmachines~42Quest Name For 754754rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~5Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11306gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11306 Name64
