It takes 85 seconds at 480 EU/t or 60 seconds at 480 EU/t by adding Oxygen gas. Always add a gas if you can, you're saving tons of power by doing so, and you're gonna need a TON of SS. The Cracker, Large Steam Turbine, and Distillery Tower all need huge amounts of SS. A single DT uses several stacks, and you're gonna want more than just one.ORpre7491gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-2306.png7541gregtech/gt.blockmachines-42.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-5.pngLootBag (Tier 2 MV)
