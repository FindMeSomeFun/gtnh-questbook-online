gregtech/gt.metaitem.03-4010.pngNano Forge Tier 1There must a be a way to make a nano scale robots to work in a machine. Carbon ones can be made in an assembly line, but very inefficiently. There must be a better way.

What about a Nano Forge, able to cut up blocks into nano-thin sheets and then creating the first nanite, which helps create thousands of them in mere seconds.

ยง3The Nano Forge is a big multiblock requiring lots of power over the course of a couple minutes. It is able to use TT energy hatches (including lasers). The controller must have a carbon nanite to use tier 1 recipes.

Despite what NEI might claim there are no minimum voltages for the Nano Forge recipes. If you want to do a recipe you just have to achieve the raw EU/t required, no matter the voltage.0-1ANDpre26491gregtech/gt.metaitem.03-32073.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03-4010.pngCarbon Nanites\nC
