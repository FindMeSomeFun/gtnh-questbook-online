You can centrifuge glowstone dust to redstone and gold dust. Redstone is also a good source of chrome. You'll need tons of gold for HV, so it's a good idea to set this up before then.

There's actually a couple plants that produce glowstone, pick the one you like!ANDpre13220gregtech/gt.blockmachines-362.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.blockmachines-1366.png1x Copper Cable
