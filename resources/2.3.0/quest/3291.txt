The second item - Superconductor Rare-Earth Composite. This contributes to promoting the flow of energy, instead of stabilizing the structure like the previous item. Given that damage can be automatically repaired, the focus now is to make it easier for the energy to flow from one component to the next and allow for more energy input into the multi. The existing superconductors canâ€™t handle quantum flow well, so this composite can be used instead to remove all resistance to flow across the outer shell of the structure, thanks to the unique composition of the transitions between the rare-earth elements present in the composite. The transition from one to the next is so gradual that the quantum flow has no obstacles or loose ends to escape from.ANDpre32900miscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5-11.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalmiscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5-9.pngInfinity Infused Manipulato;Mobs cannot Spawn on this Block;This is NOT a TileEntity!
