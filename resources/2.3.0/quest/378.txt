378It Needs a Power Plug...Given the fact that I will be able to craft this device, it needs some kind of "plug" to get the power out. I need something to conduct immense amounts of power. I thought about superconductors, but they don't fit with the crystal casing material I have in mind. I need 2 different crystals, one for positive and one for negative charge.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32599Quest Name For 375375rewardstasksANDCheckboxcheckbox 
