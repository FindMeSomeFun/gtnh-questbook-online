For the bee path you have to go very deep into the breeding tree, but maybe you have already done that? Check the Bee Breeding tab either way.

In the DE Fusion Crafter you have 2 recipes. The better one uses an Infinity Egg from Witchery. Without any Witchery you can also just a normal dragon egg for the weaker recipe.

Once you have a bit of Hypogen you can then use that as a starting point to make more in your DTPF without any Dragonblood. I don't know why it works that way, complain to Colen.

However, you will still need more Dragonblood eventually for UMV superconductors.


There is actually another way to get Dragonblood which is similar to the DE Fusion Crafter recipes but in the mixer instead. Its even slower and less resource efficient. In particular, the dragon egg does not survive the process. So only use that if you are absolutely trying to avoid magic and bees.

Just a reminder: a fluid task just needs you to have the fluid in some container in your inventory. (cell, universal cell, large cell, volumetric cell, etc.)ANDpre25831gregtech/gt.blockmachines-965.pngrewardstasksANDFluidfluids/molten-dragonblood-.pngMolten Dragonblood
