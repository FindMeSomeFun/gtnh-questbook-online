2150One BILLION EUIf you want a stationary battery, you can make an AFSU capable of storing up to 1 billion EU and charging items. You can pick it up with a wrench, but you'll lose a percentage of the stored EU. Make sure you right-click, not left-click. Left-clicking will cause it to lose all stored EU.

As an alternative, if you can afford them, try the GT++ Energy Buffers. They are more expensive and cannot charge items, but store more, don't lose any EU, and can be configured from 1-16A. See the GT++ tab for details.

ยง3These can apparently draw infinite amps, so maybe use a diode or something if you like having the power on.ANDpreRequ2149gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32597tasksANDoptional_retrievalAFSU/ALC~01retrievalAFSU/AFSU~01rewardsitemIC2/itemBatLamaCrystal~264
