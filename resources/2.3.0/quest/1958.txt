Botany/pigment-0.png80 New Colors to Play WithWhen you plant a vanilla flower, it is already mature. Cut it with a shears to get a germling you can replant to make more. Break the flower to get a mature flower. Turn the flower into pigment using a crafting table.

To get crosses, plant flowers next to empty soil blocks. Keep an eye out for weeds. Eventually a small germling will start growing.

Remember, do this underground or in an enclosure or your TPS will regret it.0-1ANDpre19560Botany/misc-7.pngrewardsChoiceBotany/pigment-1.pngPigment\nBlack
