It instead allows the isolation of a single gene from an organism, without destroying it. The exact gene is random, and is written into an Blank Sequence. Until the sequence is analysed in an Analyser, it will be unknown what the gene is. It doesn't however need to be analysed before being sent to the Sequencer.ANDpre20950Genetics/labMachine-3.pngrewardsItemGenetics/misc-5.pngBlank Sequence
