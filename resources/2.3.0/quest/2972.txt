That’s what a HydroEnergy Pump is for. This multi-block exists in multiple tiers and will allow you to reach higher water levels (= more energy capacity). Provide the pump with vanilla water as input and pipe the fluid output into the dam. Then the dam will slowly fill up. If the dam is full or full for a pump’s voltage tier, it will void the water and energy.

That's all folks! Nothing too fancy here.

If you have any further questions, missing information or suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord. Please add '@SinTh0r4s' to your post to make sure I’ll see it.
