xpxpx
xxxxx
pxPxp
xxxxx
xpxpx

x=space, p=pedestal, P=plinth

Place a bound master orb on the plinth and the appropriate sacrifices on the pedestals. They must all be the same element. Specifically, Aether, Incendium, Aquasalus, Terrae, Tenebrae, or Sanctus.

After the lightning, the demon will appear. It won't always drop the shard, so prepare multiple sets.ANDpre7081AWWayofTime/masterBloodOrb-0.png9271dreamcraft/tile.BloodyVoid-0.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-17.pngLootBag;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
