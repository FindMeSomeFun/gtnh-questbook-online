ยง3We here at QuestBook, Inc. do not guarantee the usefulness of boats. The standard worldgen does not include oceans, so their usefulness is heavily curtailed. There are lots of rivers, but horses might be more useful if not on a server.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metatool.01~16Quest Name For 3636rewardsChoiceminecraft/fishing_rod~0Choice Name1minecraft/waterlily~0Choice Name16harvestcraft/watergarden~0Choice Name8Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinAdventure~0Item Name10dreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name10tasksANDCraftingminecraft/boat~0minecraft/boat~0 Name1
