As your air drops, the helmet will take a compressed air cell and give back an empty cell. Throw these cells into your compressor and you can easily gather clay from beneath rivers. You'll be able to make more cells later once you get an extruder or a plate bender.ANDpre18880IC2/itemArmorHazmatChestplate-64.pngrewardsItemIC2/itemCellEmpty-5.pngCompressed Air Cell
