The LOX canister is an alternate solution to refilling your oxygen tanks.

To make liquid oxygen you need to put an oxygen cell into a vacuum freezer to get a cell of liquid oxygen. Transfer this liquid oxygen into a tank, and then into a LOX canister.

To refill your oxygen tanks just put the tank and the LOX canister in the oxygen compressor to transfer oxygen, or use a oxygen collector.

Each LOX canister can fill 4 Heavy Oxygen Tanks, 6 Medium Oxygen Tanks, or 12 Light Oxygen Tanks.
