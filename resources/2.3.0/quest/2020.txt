2020A Magical BoxThis magical box is amazing. No matter how many are created, they all seem to connect to the same dimension. I can store items in one location, and pull them out somewhere else!

I can use dyes on the top of the box to assign its location, and any box with the same colors will share the same space. Using a diamond on the box locks it to me, and me alone.

Shift-rightclicking will remove the diamond and the chest will rejoin the public network.ANDpreRequThaumcraft/WandCasting~54Quest Name For 262262rewardsItemminecraft/dye~2Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalEnderStorage/enderChest~0EnderStorage/enderChest~0 Name1
