2020A Magical BoxThis magical box is amazing. No matter how many are created, they all seem to connect to the same dimension. I can store items in one location, and pull them out somewhere else!

I can use dyes on the top of the box to assign its location, and any box with the same colors will share the same space. Using a diamond on the box locks it to me, and me alone.

Shift-rightclicking will remove the diamond and the chest will rejoin the public network.ANDpreRequ262Thaumcraft/WandCasting~54tasksANDretrievalEnderStorage/enderChest~01rewardsitemminecraft/nether_star~04minecraft/dye~51minecraft/dye~21
