EnderStorage/enderChest-0.pngA Magical BoxThis magical box is amazing. No matter how many are created, they all seem to connect to the same dimension. I can store items in one location, and pull them out somewhere else!

I can use dyes on the top of the box to assign its location, and any box with the same colors will share the same space. Using a diamond on the box locks it to me, and me alone.

Shift-rightclicking will remove the diamond and the chest will rejoin the public network.0-1ANDpre2621Thaumcraft/WandCasting-54.pngrewardsItemminecraft/nether_star-0.pngNether Star\nApplicable up to: 08-Manyullyn
