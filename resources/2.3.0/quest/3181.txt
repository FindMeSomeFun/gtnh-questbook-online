bartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedcell-10011.pngUranium and Plutonium ExcitementIf you've done IC2 nukes, you must have seen this coming. The previous quest had fuel that was based on Thorium, so what comes next? Uranium and Plutonium, of course.

The byproducts you want are obtained directly from the depleted fuel, so the tasks to get through for power and breeding are exactly the same. However, since this part is about breeding, it's worth it to point out that the depleted fuel can be obtained from depleted fuel rods, after being processed in IC2 nukes. This is not the best way to do it, of course, but it bypasses the need for the Large Naquadah Reactor, an expensive multi even by ZPM standards. You will not get as much power if you don't use that multi, but you can get byproducts all the same.

The outputs themselves are quite interesting, or at least Plutonium's outputs are. Uranium will give you Lead, Bismuth (almost none), Cerium and a tiny bit of Xenon, which means that you get some Cerium and Xenon. Plutonium, on the other hand, awards you with Tritanium! This is a t2 fusion material that normally needs a lot of Radon to produce, alongside 2 separate fusion recipes, so it might be very useful to source Tritanium through the depleted Plutonium Liquid Fuel. If you do so, you'll also get some Krypton, with each bucket of depleted fuel outputting more than a 100 million Liquid Air recipe on the Distillation Tower, which is also true for the Xenon obtained from Uranium despite the very small amount obtained from it.0-1ANDpre31800gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-2078.pngrewardstasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockmachines-12732.pngLarge Naquadah Reactor\nMachine Type: Naquadah Reactor\nController block for the Naquadah Reactor\nEnvironmental Friendly!\nGenerate power with the High-energy liquid.\nConsume liquid air 2400 L/s to keep running, otherwise it will void your fuel.\nInput liquid nuclear fuel or liquid naquadah fuel.\nThe reactor will explode when there are more than ONE types of fuel in the hatch!\nConsume coolant 1000 L/s to increase the efficiency:\nIC2 Coolant 105%, Super Coolant 150%, Cryotheum 275%\nConsume excited liquid to increase the output power:\nmolten caesium | 2x power | 180 L/s \nmolten uranium-235 | 3x power | 180 L/s\nmolten naquadah | 4x power | 20 L/s\nmolten Atomic Separation Catalyst | 16x power | 20 L/s\nThe structure is too complex!\nFollow the StructureLib hologram projector to build the main structure.\n-----------------------------------------\nHold [LSHIFT] to display structure guidelines\nAdded by: Good Generator
