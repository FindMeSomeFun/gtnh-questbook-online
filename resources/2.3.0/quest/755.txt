gregtech/gt.metatool.01-160-Iron-Rubber.png§6§lBetter Than Duct TapeUsing a soldering iron tool to remove the "burned out circuits" message is cheaper than duct tape. 

The soldering iron requires one soldering material item and 10,000 EU. Valid soldering materials are fine wires, rods, and ingots made from either tin, lead, or soldering alloy. The soldering iron will consume the first such material it finds in the player's inventory. Since you'll likely have more than enough, Fine Wires of Soldering Alloy are probably best.

You can also use it to adjust the redstone strength from weak to strong emitted by GT machines.

Also, while holding it all pipes, wires, and cables will look very small, so that you can see everything past them, and also be sure of the exact connections.

In order to "complete" the quest you'll need to charge the soldering iron after you craft it.

For the other problems other tools are necessary.
