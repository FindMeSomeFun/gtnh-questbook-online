309Shards of Opposite WorldsThis morning, you just wanted to facepalm yourself to death. During your past journeys, you have already seen strangely colored shards. But unlike the primal shards you use every day, these seem to contain the raw essence of their dimension. Heaven and Hell... so to speak. Two opposite worlds.

You think you can use them to make something...Powerful.
