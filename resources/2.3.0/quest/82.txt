82gregtech/gt.blockgem3-4.png0An Unexpected Bonus17-1Because we're nice developers, we decided to add a little bonus if you happen to compress charcoal. Use it in the bricked blast furnace, or in a boiler, it yields 10 times the burn time of a piece of charcoal. So one charcoal for free. This bonus only occurs on the first compression step. (But for fanciness, you should definitely get a quintuple one!)

Of course, if you're not using BBFs or boilers, they're kinda useless.ANDpre6980gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-15305.pngrewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag-4.pngLootBag (Tier 1 LV)
