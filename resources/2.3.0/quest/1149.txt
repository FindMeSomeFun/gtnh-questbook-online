1149§5§lA New Alloy - MagnaliumWondering why you need magnalium now? It's not for GT machines but for a material update for your crossbow.

Go to the Twilight Forest and find an Olivine/Glauconite vein located at Y 10-40 or in the Overworld a Glauconite Soapstone mix located at Y 20-50 and a Granitic Mineral Vein in the Overworld Located at Y 50-60 (The Gypsum vein you will need for the Bricked Blast Furnace).

With your Ore Washer you can also get Magnesium out of ores like Magnesite.

You already made some Aluminium dust before. It will get easier once you have an EBF or an MV electrolyzer.

Combine both in your alloy smelter to get magnalium.ANDpreRequ673gregtech/gt.blockmachines~281tasksANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~20196retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~113139rewardsitemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~41itemdreamcraft/item.CoinAdventure~015dreamcraft/item.CoinSmith~015dreamcraft/item.CoinChemist~015dreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~015
