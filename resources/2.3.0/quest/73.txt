gregtech/gt.blockmachines-11.png§3§lBasic Crafting: Machine HullsAll machines need a hull to keep their private parts together. Good news is: They are crafted in the same way for every tier, only the materials change.

§3As noted on the tooltip, you can also use a machine hull to pass EU through, at 1A. This can be useful for a 1A diode on Thermos servers, splitting cables from 4A->1A or in a cleanroom later. You can also pass items or fluids through it.1-1ANDpre671gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1360.png9481gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11304.pngrewardsItemharvestcraft/poachedpearItem-0.pngPoached Pear\nharvestcraft:poachedpearItem\nDiminishing returns start after\neating any food 10 more times
