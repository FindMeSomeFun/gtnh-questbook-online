§3As noted on the tooltip, you can also use a machine hull to pass EU through, at 1A. This can be useful for a 1A diode on Thermos servers, splitting cables from 4A->1A or in a cleanroom later. You can also pass items or fluids through it.ANDpre671gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1360.png9481gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11304.pngrewardsItemharvestcraft/poachedpearItem-0.pngPoached Pear;harvestcraft:poachedpearItem
