2648The Final FrontierThere're no more rockets to make after this, though there's still at least one more place to visit. After this is the Deep Dark, which has all the ores+more.

Although you get access to six new planets, there's only two new veins. And don't complain that Barnarda should be Barnard, we can't fix it.

The Barnarda system is to the NNW, and you can visit Barnada C, E, and F.
The Alpha Centauri system is to the NE, and you can vist Alpha Centauri Bb (Proxima Centauri is not visitable). ยง3Remember to wear your SpaceSuit!ยงr
The Tau Ceti system is to the SSW, and you can visit the habitable planet Tau Ceti E.
The Vega System is to the WNW, and you can visit the planet Vega B.

The new veins are Cadmium and Samarium. The ores are Cadmium, Caesium, Cerium, Lanthanum, Neodymium, Samarium, and Tartarite.

You can get Awakened Draconium from small ores on Barnarda E, Barnarda F, Tau Ceti E, and Vega B.
You can get Bedrockium from small ores on Barnarda F.
You can get Infinity Catalyst from small ores on Vega B.

In addition to planet ores and blocks, grab some Barnarda C Saplings and Dirt so you can grow some more if you need it for Radox (lol). You can also grab some more Unknown Crystal Shards from the Rainbow Crystals lying around.

More importantly you should collect Seaweed from Tau Ceti E. You need it to make UEV circuits, and though you can make it as well, you need some to begin with. The unknown liquid to grow these is however found in lakes and underground on Barnarda C.AND2616gregtech/gt.blockmachines~19ANDcheckboxGalaxySpace/item.Tier8Rocket~01
