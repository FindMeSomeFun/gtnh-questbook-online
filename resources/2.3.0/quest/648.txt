You will very quickly discover that, while it is fast and cheap, it's empty in the blink of an eye. Despite this, it is useful in combination with the hang glider to get into the air and to get away from hairy situations.ANDpre6470ProjRedExpansion/projectred.expansion.jetpack-0.pngrewardsChoiceProjRedCore/projectred.core.part-56.pngElectrotine
