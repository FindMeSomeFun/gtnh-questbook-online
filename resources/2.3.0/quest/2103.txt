Only the young stage of organisms can be injected, which are larvae (bees), pollen (trees and flowers) and caterpillars (butterflies). Bee larvae can be converted into drones by incubating with Liquid Growth Medium.ANDpreRequGenetics/machine~2Quest Name For 20982098rewardsItemBinnieCore/containerCylinder~772Item Name8enhancedlootbags/lootbag~26Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalGenetics/machine~3Genetics/machine~3 Name1
