1126§3§lAlumiteIt's upgrade time again. You could in principle make alumite by mixing obsidian, steel and aluminium in the smeltery. But to get a much better yield, you can show you are a GregTech hero and search NEI for an alternate recipe using dusts. Alumite pickaxes are able to mine ardite in the Nether.

Leave the rest of your Alumite as liquid in your smeltery, you'll want it to make the Tool Forge. You need 16 ingots in the smeltery to make 2 Large Plates.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11305Quest Name For 6565rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~2Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name10tasksANDRetrievalTConstruct/materials~15TConstruct/materials~15 Name1
