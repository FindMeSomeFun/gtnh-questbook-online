2063Long Distance Power DeliveryNo mage wants to be restricted to short flying times. With this spire from the Automagy discipline you can transmit magical energy directy to your flying harness. To get the correct Thaumium block, compress 9 ingots to get the GT Thaumium block and then chisel that block to get the correct type.

This multiblock requires centi-vis to operate. You can use 2-6 Thaumostatic Pylons, with additional pylons extending the range. Provide the construct Aer centi-vis to operate, and and it will accept Potentia essentia to transfer to flyers. The construct will also accept Aer and Volatus essentia to increase the range and rate of transfer, respectively. Right-click the sides of the controller to control which type of essentia each side will accept.AND2060Thaumcraft/HoverHarness~0ANDretrievalThaumcraft/blockCosmeticSolid~41itemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~101
