Be careful, if the output hatches are full, the reactor will void any extra products!

Some of the old recipes can now be done much more easily in the LCR using circuit 24, skipping one or more steps.

The LCR also counts as a cleanroom for any cleanroom recipes.

You will also need:
1 Maintenance Hatch
1 Energy Hatch
0+ Input Bus (if a recipe has an item input. For full automation, you should probably use 1 for each material)
0-1 Output Bus (if a recipe has an item output)
2+ Input Hatch (use 1 for every fluid)
1+ Output Hatch (same as above)

You can use a screwdriver on an output hatch to cycle through its modes. Use shift-right click to go directly to specific fluid mode, then lock the fluid with a cell for easier automation. This works on more than just the LCR.ANDpre1601gregtech/gt.blockmachines-13.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.blockmachines-5683.pngLarge PTFE Fluid Pipe;Fluid Capacity: 19,200 L/sec;Heat Limit: 600 K
