385A Few More Things...Ok, I think I have everything I need to assemble the device. Can you assist me with some additional materials? I need to update some of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged some of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.

Some of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.

Good lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?

Do you see that pile of Rhodium and Palladium over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?

Can you help me with this?ANDpreRequharvestcraft/supremepizzaItem~0Quest Name For 376376GalaxySpace/item.UnknowCrystal~0Quest Name For 381381AWWayofTime/bloodMagicBaseItems~28Quest Name For 382382TaintedMagic/ItemMaterial~5Quest Name For 383383appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial~47Quest Name For 384384rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~42Item Name2Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianIII~0Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32088gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32088 Name10Retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32723gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32723 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~17gregtech/gt.blockmachines~17 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32675gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32675 Name2
