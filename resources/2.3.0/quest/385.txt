gregtech/gt.blockmachines-17.pngA Few More Things...Ok, I think I have everything I need to assemble the device. Can you assist me with some additional materials? I need to update some of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged some of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.

Some of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.

Good lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?

Do you see that pile of Rhodium and Palladium over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?

It seems, that the stabilizers need... stabilizing... But I'm out of field generators. Can you help me with this?0-1ANDpre3760harvestcraft/supremepizzaItem-0.png3810GalaxySpace/item.UnknowCrystal-0.png3820AWWayofTime/bloodMagicBaseItems-28.png3830TaintedMagic/ItemMaterial-5.png3840appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial-47.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-42.pngLootBag\nYou feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...
