3265Experienced BotanistThe rosa arcana transmutes experience into mana. A player standing near it will have their experience drained for this purpose. This process is unfortunately not very practical to automate, as the experience can only be extracted directly from a player, and not from orbs on the ground or any method of storage. It might be wise to place it somewhere you spend a lot of time.ANDpreRequBotania/rune~2Quest Name For 32633263rewardsItemminecraft/experience_bottle~0Item Name8dreamcraft/item.CoinFlowerII~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalBotania/specialFlower~0Botania/specialFlower~0 Name1
