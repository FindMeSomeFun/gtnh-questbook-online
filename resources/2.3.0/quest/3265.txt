3265Experienced BotanistThe rosa arcana transmutes experience into mana. A player standing near it will have their experience drained for this purpose. This process is unfortunately not very practical to automate, as the experience can only be extracted directly from a player, and not from orbs on the ground or any method of storage. It might be wise to place it somewhere you spend a lot of time.AND3263Botania/rune~2ANDretrievalBotania/specialFlower~01itemminecraft/experience_bottle~08dreamcraft/item.CoinFlowerII~05
