The aluminium oreberries can be planted on cropsticks, and macerated to get small quantites of aluminium for molds if you can't find aluminium gravel.

Note: The book says a 3x3 base, but you can make a smeltery with a smaller base. Taller/wider smelteries can do more items at one time, conserving fuel.

The smeltry does not double ores in GTNH. Later machines will help you there.ORpre29850StevesCarts/CartModule-23.png30310minecraft/wooden_shovel-0.pngrewardstasksANDCheckboxcheckbox-.pngCheckbox
