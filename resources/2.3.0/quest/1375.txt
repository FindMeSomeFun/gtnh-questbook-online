It is used to switch out blocks in the world with blocks in the player's inventory. Shift right-clicking on a block with it equipped will attune the focus to the block, making it the substitute block. Left-clicking on another block will replace it with the substitute block. Right-clicking will transform a 5x5 area of blocks that have air on one side. This can go through walls or into caves, so be careful. This range can be extended by using a Focal Manipulator. Each use costs 0.05 ordo 0.05 perditio and 0.05 terra.

This focus can be upgraded at the Focal Manipulator.ANDpre2271Thaumcraft/blockTable-15.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-9.pngLootBag (Magic Novice;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
