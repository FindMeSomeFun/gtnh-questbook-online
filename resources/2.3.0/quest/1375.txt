1375Wand Focus Equal TradeWand Focus: Equal Trade is a wand focus added by Thaumcraft 4. It is used to switch out blocks in the world with blocks in the player's inventory. Shift right-clicking on a block with it equipped will attune the focus to the block, making it the substitute block. Left-clicking on another block will replace it with the substitute block. Right-clicking will transform a 5x5 area of blocks that have air on one side. This can go through walls or into caves, so be careful. This range can be extended by using a Focal Manipulator. Each use costs 0.05 ordo 0.05 perditio and 0.05 terra.

This focus can be upgraded at the Focal Manipulator.ANDpreRequThaumcraft/blockTable~15Quest Name For 227227rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~9Item Name1Thaumcraft/ItemLootBag~1Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalThaumcraft/FocusTrade~0Thaumcraft/FocusTrade~0 Name1
