3137Bet On The DistillusIV brings forth GT++ multis, including an upgrade for the Distillation Tower, called the Dangote Distillus. In structure, it's exactly the same as the DT, but it uses a different controller that has a more complicated recipe. It needs more expensive items, and it's also locked to an IV Chemical Plant, which makes it a very expensive craft if it is the only use you have for that plant. 

That said, it solves the issue of DTs being slow, and those are essentially the backbone of all of these renewable setups. How many quad DTs are you going to need for reliable IV/LuV power, I might ask? Just go for it.ORpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~15Quest Name For 213213miscutils/nitrobenzene~0Quest Name For 31333133rewardsItemdreamcraft/item.CoinChemistIII~0Item Name2tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockcasings4~1gregtech/gt.blockcasings4~1 Name200
