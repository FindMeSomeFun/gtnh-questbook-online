625§3§lMoving Your Tanks, Chests, and BarrelsWant to move your chests and barrels without spilling all the things (buildcraft™)? No problem! Make a dolly and you can carry your full chests, barrels or storage drawers anywhere you want. But be warned, you will get a slowness debuff so hopefully you don't have to travel very far. Non-portable buildcraft and iron tanks can be moved without losing fluids too.

§4PS: Later on you can fly or make a traveller's belt to get around the debuff.AND65gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~1130569gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11880ANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~173051retrievalJABBA/mover~01itemJABBA/barrel~05choiceJABBA/upgradeStructural~03JABBA/upgradeStructural~11StorageDrawersBop/fullDrawers1~55enhancedlootbags/lootbag~21itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~010
