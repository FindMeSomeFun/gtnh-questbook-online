625§3§lMoving Your Tanks, Chests, and BarrelsWant to move your chests and barrels without spilling all the things (buildcraft™)? No problem! Make a dolly and you can carry your full chests, barrels or storage drawers anywhere you want. But be warned, you will get a slowness debuff so hopefully you don't have to travel very far. Non-portable buildcraft and iron tanks can be moved without losing fluids too.

§4PS: Later on you can fly or make a traveller's belt to get around the debuff.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11305Quest Name For 6565gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11880Quest Name For 6969rewardsItemJABBA/barrel~0Item Name5Choiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~2Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name10tasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~17305gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~17305 Name1RetrievalJABBA/mover~0JABBA/mover~0 Name1
