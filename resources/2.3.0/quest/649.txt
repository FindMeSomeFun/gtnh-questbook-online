649Coal Steam JetpackYour coal jetpack needs coal and water to produce steam. After a short warm-up period you can go and take it for a ride. Keep in mind you will need your glider to make a soft landing.

Put your jetpack on your back and hit Shift and the adventure backpack's action-key to start it.

Max flying height for this jetpack is Y-185.

Vertical velocity decreases linearly with height after overcoming optimal height - 135 for jetpack and 100 for copter.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11019Quest Name For 103103rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~5Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name25tasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32601gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32601 Name1Retrievaladventurebackpack/coalJetpack~0adventurebackpack/coalJetpack~0 Name1
