38§2§lMaking Better ToolsWith aluminium and copper, you can create a material with a higher melting temperature, "Aluminum Brass", which can be used to cast better tools.

But first you'll need a smeltery. See the Multiblock Goals tab for details. You can also grab some extra blocks from some villages, but they don't count towards the quest.

You can then use your fancy new bronze to make better tools with a higher mining level.

§3Remember, you need to gather mining xp or use an upgrade slot to get the full mining level on your bronze pickaxe.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11035Quest Name For 3030gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~2300Quest Name For 3535gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~2019Quest Name For 18661866rewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.02~32243Item Name2Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSmith~0Item Name5dreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalTConstruct/metalPattern~2TConstruct/metalPattern~2 Name1RetrievalTConstruct/metalPattern~3TConstruct/metalPattern~3 Name1RetrievalTConstruct/pickaxeHead~14TConstruct/pickaxeHead~14 Name1RetrievalTConstruct/shovelHead~14TConstruct/shovelHead~14 Name1
