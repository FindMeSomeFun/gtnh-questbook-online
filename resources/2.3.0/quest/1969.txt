First up, Railcraft lanterns. These come in stone and metallic varieties. The stone varieties don't need much to craft. One plus/minus for these lanterns is that they are solid blocks - while you cannot walk through them, they also do not fall if the blocks around them are removed. Search "lantern" in NEI for more varieties. They are a bit annoying to craft now, but if you check NEI you can make them pretty easily with assemblers later.ANDpre361gregtech/gt.metatool.01-16.pngrewardsItemRailcraft/lantern.metal-1.pngGold Lantern\nMobs cannot Spawn on this Block
