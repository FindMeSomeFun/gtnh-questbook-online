Breed the drones with your template princesses so you can prevent the harmful effects from destroying your base. Also, their Hellish temperature and Normal humidity requirements are interesting - use a Acclimatiser from Genetics to make the bee tolerant or other methods to adjust the biome. Must be bred in the Nether. Breed them from Ghastly and Hateful.

To get their Blaze Rod drop, however, you'll need to place them in a biome that matches their default requirements.
