If the LP in your network falls to 0 while you're working with this alchemy, you will get a permanent Nausea debuff until it is increased again.ANDpreRequThaumcraft/blockCosmeticSolid~7Quest Name For 238238AWWayofTime/blankSlate~0Quest Name For 407407rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~16Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinBloodII~0Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalAWWayofTime/blockWritingTable~0AWWayofTime/blockWritingTable~0 Name1
