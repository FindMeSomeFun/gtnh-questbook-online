gregtech/gt.blockmachines-812.pngEU packets flowing everywhere......in my dreams. What if instead of having battery packs on every generator, we could centralize all the generation in one location? Put it away from the well travelled parts of the the base? Out in the country somewhere?  Let the animals deal with the pollution.  Anyways, let's start working on a Power Sub-Station to store EU and deliver it to our base.0-1ANDpre14161gregtech/gt.blockmachines-810.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.blockmachines-34.pngEV Dynamo Hatch\nGenerating electric Energy from Multiblocks\nPuts out up to 1 Amp\nVoltage OUT: 2,048 (EV)\nCapacity: 16,896 EU
