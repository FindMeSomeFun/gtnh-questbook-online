1454Rocket Tier 3After days of hard work and a hundred tons of stacks of iTNT your third rocket is finally ready.

You need to use Dense Hydrazine Rocket Fuel or better to fuel it.

ยง3If you started on an older version of GTNH and still have some LMP-103S, you can also use that as rocket fuel!
