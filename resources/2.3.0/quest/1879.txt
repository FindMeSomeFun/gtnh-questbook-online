1879§a§lCreate New Materials Out of Pure EnergyUsing the scanner, you can scan certain items (check the replicator's NEI recipes) to store the information of the item to a data orb so you can make copies of them with the replicator. This process uses a varying amount of UUM and time, depending on the item. Scanning also takes forever.

Some items you might want to replicate include:
Indium
Platline metals like Iridium and Osmium
Neon, Krypton, Xenon from liquid air distilling
Oganesson
