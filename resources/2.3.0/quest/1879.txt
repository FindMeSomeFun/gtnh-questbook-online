This process uses a varying amount of UUM and time, depending on the item. Scanning also takes forever.

Some items you might want to replicate include:
Indium
Platline metals like Iridium and Osmium
Neon, Krypton, Xenon from liquid air distilling
Oganesson

For some things (Oganesson), this might be considered the only reasonable way of getting a decent amount.ANDpre18800gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32671.pngrewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag-7.pngLootBag\nYou feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...\nEnchant with a Fortune III Book
