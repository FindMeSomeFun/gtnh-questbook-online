2268Who Needs Friends?Luggage is better than a dumb old traveling trunk. It automatically picks up dropped items, saving you time while mining. It's near-invulnerable, including in lava. It will follow you like an eager puppy, to the ends of the earth - but you probably should pick her up before changing dimensions. A lightning strike can provide more room. Shift right-clicking will turn it back into an item without losing its contents. Look for her in the GTNH tab of the Thaumonomicon.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~27366Quest Name For 266266rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~10Item Name1ChoiceThaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~0Choice Name1Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~1Choice Name1Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~2Choice Name1Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~3Choice Name1Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~5Choice Name1Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~5Choice Name1tasksANDRetrievalOpenBlocks/luggage~0OpenBlocks/luggage~0 Name1
