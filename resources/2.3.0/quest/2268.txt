2268Who Needs Friends?Luggage is better than a dumb old traveling trunk. It automatically picks up dropped items, saving you time while mining. It's near-invulnerable, including in lava. It will follow you like an eager puppy, to the ends of the earth - but you probably should pick her up before changing dimensions. A lightning strike can provide more room. Shift right-clicking will turn it back into an item without losing its contents. Look for her in the GTNH tab of the Thaumonomicon.AND266gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~27366ANDretrievalOpenBlocks/luggage~01itemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~101choiceThaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~01Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~11Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~21Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~31Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~51Thaumcraft/ItemGolemUpgrade~51
