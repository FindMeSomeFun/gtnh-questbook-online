1200§d§l§f§c§lMaking Power With Your PlasmaNow that you have a reactor, it's time to utilize it to create power. 

The simplest plasma you can make for power is Helium plasma, but it also provides a lot of power. Deuterium is renewable from water, and you can get Helium-3 from Endstone.

However, you will need a way to convert the plasma into EU. To do this you will need a large plasma turbine. This will also need a dynamo hatch that can handle the power you're outputting. For Helium plasma, you will want a LuV Buffered Dynamo or above.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~1193Quest Name For 12121212rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~41Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianIII~0Item Name5tasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32090gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32090 Name2Optionalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~905gregtech/gt.blockmachines~905 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~1153gregtech/gt.blockmachines~1153 Name1
