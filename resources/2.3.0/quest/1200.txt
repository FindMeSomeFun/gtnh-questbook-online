1200§d§l§f§c§lMaking Power With Your PlasmaNow that you have a reactor, it's time to utilize it to create power. 

The simplest plasma you can make for power is Helium plasma, but it also provides a lot of power. Deuterium is renewable from water, and you can get Helium-3 from Endstone.

However, you will need a way to convert the plasma into EU. To do this you will need a large plasma turbine. This will also need a dynamo hatch that can handle the power you're outputting. For Helium plasma, you will want a LuV Buffered Dynamo or above.ANDpreRequ1212gregtech/gt.blockmachines~1193tasksANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03~320902optional_retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~9051retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~11531rewardschoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01~326064gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~326152gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~326352gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~326452gregtech/gt.blockmachines~24052enhancedlootbags/lootbag~411itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianIII~05
