Instead of packing up all your stuff and moving somewhere else, why not try changing the biome? There are a couple different ways to do so in this modpack:

Use the Arcane Terrestrial Reformer from Witching Gadgets
-Requires EV Circuits, Tungstensteel, Rocket Tier III
-Also requires Infusion, Void Metal (sufficient warp), Energized Node for CV, lots of Essentia
-16 block radius
-Can only change to a few specific Vanilla or Thaumcraft biomes
-Kind of slow

Use Ritual of Gaia's Transformation from Blood Magic
-Requires Void Metal, Infusion, Tungstensteel
-Requires getting deep into BM (and the warp that come with it)
-Requires 1,000,000 LP, Master Blood Orb, Tier 4 Altar and Awakened Activation Crystal
-10 block radius, can be exactly specified with bloodstone bricks (either type)
-Cannot specify which biome you get, you can only change the temperature/humidity within the 0.0 - 2.0 range and hope
-Some biomes may be impossible due to limited range and overlap
-Adjust temperature/humidity with items on 8 plinths around the Master Ritual Stone
-Need to relog to see changes
-Very little documentation or explanation
-Fast

Use the Brew of Shifting Seasons from Witchery
-Small range, depends on the level of the brew (power, not dispersal extent)
-Biome can be exactly specified
-Crafted using the complicated custom brew system
-Can add different ingredients to change range of the brew
-At min changes a single block
-At max has about a 3 block (circular) radius
-Instant (once you use it)

Use the Rite of Shifting Seasons from Witchery
-Requires Stainless Steel, Greatwood Scepter or better for the Distillery
-You have to do a bunch of witchery stuff
-Not hard once you're done it once
-Extremely large range, 16/32/48 block (circular) radius
-Biome can be exactly specified
-Sometimes fails in specific chunks
-Very Fast
