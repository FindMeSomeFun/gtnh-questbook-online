3275IC2/upgradeModule-0.png0Liquid Cooling Tower12-1I have started to hit the limit of the multiblock without overclocking it, so I decided to give it a liquid cooler to cool down the mechanism. This will allow it to overclock like every other multi with 2xSpeed 4xEU/t.

I will need to provide some distilled water to its hatch to avoid blockage in the pipes.

ยง3The Liquid Cooling Tower allows the Multiblock to have 2/4 OC at the cost of 10/s of distilled water when running. The hatch is placed in the center of the Liquid Cooling Tower.ANDpre26751Avaritia/Resource-6.png32730gregtech/gt.blockmachines-356.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines-4431.pngDamascus Steel Frame Box\nJust something you can put covers on.
