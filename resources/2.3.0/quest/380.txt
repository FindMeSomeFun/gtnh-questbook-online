380A Problem that MattersI need to open a wormhole. But for that, I need an immense gravitational field. One like those created upon the death of a massive star, a black hole. But I can't really "kill" a sun for this. I need to compress matter somehow... But... How? I think I may need a specialized machine for this, one that does not use explosions, as that won't get dense enough.ANDpreRequ375gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32599tasksANDcheckboxenhancedlootbags/lootbag~71rewards
