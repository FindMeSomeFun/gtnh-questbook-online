gregtech/gt.blockores-828.png§b§lCeres TripYou can find the same ores as Callisto minus callisto ice here, but the real goal is the dungeon and the small ores: Naquadah and Quantium.

Naquadah is used for efficient Silicon Wafer, as well as highly advanced components you'll need tons of at ZPM.

Quantium is used for T5 Rocket and item pipe that has the best throughput in GT.
