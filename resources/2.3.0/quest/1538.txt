Naquadah is used for efficient Silicon Wafer, as well as highly advanced components you'll need tons of at ZPM.

Quantium is used for T5 Rocket and item pipe that has the best throughput in GT.

Make sure to bring your MBM to maximize ore yield.ANDpre2151GalacticraftMars/item.itemTier3Rocket-0.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-24.pngLootBag (Space Invaders Asteroids)
