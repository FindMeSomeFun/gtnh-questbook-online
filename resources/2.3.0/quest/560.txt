560§6§lRailcraft Steam PowerAs an alternative way to make steam you can use the railcraft boilers. They require at least one firebox.

More than one size is possible: (1x1 which the quest gets you to make) 2x2 and 3x3.

Provide water and coal to the firebox. Make sure you don't run out of water or...BOOM.

Each boiler needs 1, 2 or 3 layers of tanks on top, equal to the size (1x1x1, 2x2x2, or 3x3x3) - see the quests linked below.ANDpreRequ59gregtech/gt.GregTech_FluidDisplay~89tasksANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~170324retrievalRailcraft/machine.beta~51rewardsitemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~170324harvestcraft/figjellysandwichItem~03itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~010
