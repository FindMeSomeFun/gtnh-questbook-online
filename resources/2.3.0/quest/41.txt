The gloves have to be placed in the Baubles ring slots of Thaumcraft. You also have to place each in the correct slot, you'll get a notification if it's wrong.

For the protection effect, the hot item has to be in your active slot. I wonder if there is some way to carry more than a few buckets at a time?ANDpre431Natura/barleyFood-3.pngrewardsItemIguanaTweaksTConstruct/clayBucketFired-0.pngFired Clay Bucket
