ยง6You'll need it for a ton of stuff like UIV and UMV superconductors, UEV+ hatches, or parts of the Dyson Swarm.ยงr

Compared to the previous plastics, most of the steps required here are not chemical reactions. They are also very slow, so you might want to use a mega multiblock to help with that. This production line also underlines the necessity of large-scale plasma production. You will only need more going forward.

ยง3The Heavy Radox you get as a byproduct can be used for MkV Naquadah Fuel.ANDpre27170bartworks/BioLabParts-0.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-17979.pngRadox Polymer Plat;C\u2081\u2084Os\u2081\u2081O\u2087Ag\u2083SpH\u2082O
