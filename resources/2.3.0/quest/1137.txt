1137§9§lKinetic Power HVThe Kinetic Generator will transform mechanical energy into electricity. The EU output depends on the KU input. It is most commonly used together with a Kinetic Wind Generator or Kinetic Water Generator. The Kinetic Steam Generator only has one tier, so your should probably use a Steam Turbine instead.

When placing a kinetic generator, any time, the "input" side is the side facing you.  So you will place the kinetic generator, then the wind/water/steam gen, and then place a rotor inside. Power can be drawn from any side of the kinetic generator, up to the rated amount per side. 

WARNING: Breaking a kinetic generator improperly will not return the generator.  Use a GT wrench, and right-CLICK it.  It should drop immediately.  Try again if it just changed directions. ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11028Quest Name For 860860rewardsChoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32602Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianI~0Item Name5tasksANDOptionalIC2/itemPartCircuitAdv~0IC2/itemPartCircuitAdv~0 Name2Optionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32538gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32538 Name1RetrievalIC2/blockGenerator~9IC2/blockGenerator~9 Name1
