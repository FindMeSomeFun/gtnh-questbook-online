Botania/specialFlower-0-endoflame.pngIs this a combustion generator?The endoflame burns combustible materials in order to produce mana. It can efficiently consume fuels with a burn time of up to 64000 per item (equivalent to four blocks of coal); any burn time beyond this will be wasted. Endoflames don't die like passive flowers do, and are simple to use, so it's a good idea to make several of them.0-1ANDpre32621Botania/manaResource-23.pngrewardsItemRailcraft/cube-0.pngBlock of Coal Coke\n32,000 Fuel Units\nMobs cannot Spawn on this Block\nBurn Time: 32000
