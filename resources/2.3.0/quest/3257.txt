3257Is this a combustion generator?The endoflame burns combustible materials in order to produce mana. It can efficiently consume fuels with a burn time of up to 64000 per item (equivalent to four blocks of coal); any burn time beyond this will be wasted. Endoflames don't die like passive flowers do, and are simple to use, so it's a good idea to make several of them.AND3262Botania/manaResource~23ANDretrievalBotania/specialFlower~02itemRailcraft/cube~04dreamcraft/item.CoinFlowerI~020
