946§1§lBamboo FenceMaybe you're lucky and started off in a bamboo forest. Bamboo is a very useful tree since it grows really fast and when you break the bottom-most block, the whole thing comes apart. You can use them as sticks, or you can place the bamboo sticks and they will grow and protect your base behind a 3 block tall wall. Alternatively, you can also use Berry Bushes. Well, assuming you don't just make a fence.ANDpreRequminecraft/chest~0Quest Name For 33rewardsChoiceBiomesOPlenty/saplings~2Choice Name20TConstruct/trap.punji~0Choice Name10Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalBiomesOPlenty/bamboo~0BiomesOPlenty/bamboo~0 Name64
