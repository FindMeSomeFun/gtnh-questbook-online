BiomesOPlenty/planks-10.png§1§lBamboo FenceMaybe you're lucky and started off in a bamboo forest. Bamboo is a very useful tree since it grows really fast and when you break the bottom-most block, the whole thing comes apart. You can use them as sticks, or you can place the bamboo sticks and they will grow and protect your base behind a 3 block tall wall. Alternatively, you can also use Berry Bushes. Well, assuming you don't just make a fence.0-1ANDpre31minecraft/chest-0.pngrewardsChoiceBiomesOPlenty/saplings-2.pngBamboo Sapling\nBurn Time: 100
