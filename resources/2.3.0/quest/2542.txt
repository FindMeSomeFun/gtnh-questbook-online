The Magnet Card does not pull items to you. Instead, it allows you to automatically deposit them into the network. You can right-click to change the white/blacklist, or shift-right-click to change the mode.ANDpreRequ1300appliedenergistics2/item.ToolWirelessTerminal~02535appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiMaterial~47tasksANDretrievalae2wct/magnetCard~01rewardsitemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~381itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~02
