How about go borrow one from the locals? They will surely be happy to share it with an unfriendly adventurer that just dismantlled their bricked railway station.

The villager are too dumb that they spent all their seared bricks without adding a few key components like faucets or drains. You still need to craft some smeltry bricks yourselves... 

Totally not useful tip: if you hold off building this long enough, you will be able to break down seared brick blocks into seared brick items with a forge hammer or extractor.
