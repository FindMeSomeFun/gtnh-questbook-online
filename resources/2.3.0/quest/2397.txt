It will need a minecart load of resources, so start mining!

Catalysts are needed in some recipes, place them in the Catalyst Housing. They use durability, this includes ones that don't look like it.

ยง3You can make Silicon Carbide in the mixer, you don't need the ABS.ยงr

Valid solid casings: (Determines CP Tier for recipes)
1 Strong Bronze Machine Casing
2 Solid Steel Machine Casing
3 Sturdy Aluminium Machine Casing
4 Clean Stainless Steel Machine Casing
5 Stable Titanium Machine Casing
6 Robust Tungstensteel Casing
7 Vigorous Laurenium Machine Casing
8 Rugged Botmium Machine Casing

Valid machine casings: (Determines maximum hatch/bus tier)
LV-UHV Machine Casing, UHV unlocks any hatch/bus.

Valid pipe casings: (+2 Parallels, -20% chance to consume catalyst durability per pipe casing starting with 2 parallels and 100% chance for the first one.)
Bronze
Steel
Titanium
Tungstensteel

All coils from Cupronickel to Eternal are valid. Each one increases speed by +50%, starting at 50% speed for Cupronickel.

ยง3Additionally: If you have at least Awakened Draconium Coils and Tungstensteel pipe casings, then no catalyst is consumed at all!ANDpre9431gregtech/gt.blockmachines-423.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-6-enchanted.pngLootBag (Tier 3 HV;Your luck is increased by 100 %;Fortune III;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
