If there was a material that could move itself it could allow for an even more compex nanite with great speeds... Thankfully with the DTPF fully functional we can make it, transcendent metal.

§3Same thing as the neutronium nanite, but this nanite allows for tier 3 nanites to be made in the nano forge.ANDpre32371gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32017.png32800gregtech/gt.metaitem.03-4129.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03-4581.pngTranscendent Metal Nanites
