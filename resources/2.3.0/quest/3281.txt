3281Nano Forge Tier 3Neutronium nanites are slow moving, but that allowed them to have a complex nanite network. If there was a material that could move itself it could allow for an even more compex nanite with great speeds... Thankfully with the DTPF fully functional we can make it, transcendent metal.

ยง3Same thing as the neutronium nanite, but this nanite allows for tier 3 nanites to be made in the nano forge.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32017Quest Name For 32373237gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~4129Quest Name For 32803280rewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03~4581gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~4581 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockcasings8~10gregtech/gt.blockcasings8~10 Name1gregtech/gt.blockmachines~4501gregtech/gt.blockmachines~4501 Name1gregtech/gt.blockcasings2~5gregtech/gt.blockcasings2~5 Name1
