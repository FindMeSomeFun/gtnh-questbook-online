These tools can also be enchanted like vanilla tools.

The Ender will increase wither skull and ender pearl drops. It can be upgraded to teleport the player.

Dark shears can be empowered, and then will shear a large area, including leaves. Handy for clearing away that giant redwood! Maybe you will find other uses for it.

The axe, once empowered, can be recharged wirelessly while in farming station.

The pick? Well, it can mine cobalt I guess if you haven't gotten a tool capable of that yet. You could keep it around to use for base decorations if your normal pick is too fast, I suppose.ANDpre1380EnderIO/itemAlloy-6.pngrewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag-5.pngLootBag (Tier 2 MV;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
