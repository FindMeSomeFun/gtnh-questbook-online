It shares some features from vanilla wolves and mules: it can be tamed and attacks mobs that threaten its owners, and can be equipped with a special chest to transport items.

As an allied mob, Slimelings will actively help and follow the player-owner and will attempt to protect them. They can also have a neutral behavior, that is, they can attack if provoked or hurt by non-owners.

Items that you can feed Slimelings with:

Boat
Cooked fish
Gunpowder
Gold ingot
Redstone repeater
Wooden door

Slimelings can be equipped by their owners with a Slimeling Inventory Bag to transport items.

To complete this quest get any one of the eggs - note you may need a Heavy Duty Pickaxe.ANDpre14291GalacticraftMars/item.spaceshipTier2-0.pngrewardsChoiceGalacticraftMars/item.null-4.pngSlimeling Inventory Bag
