1471SlimelingThe Slimeling is a utility mob that spawns from Slimeling Eggs found on the surface of Mars. It shares some features from vanilla wolves and mules: it can be tamed and attacks mobs that threaten its owners, and can be equipped with a special chest to transport items.

As an allied mob, Slimelings will actively help and follow the player-owner and will attempt to protect them. They can also have a neutral behavior, that is, they can attack if provoked or hurt by non-owners.

Items that you can feed Slimelings with:

Boat
Cooked fish
Gunpowder
Gold ingot
Redstone repeater
Wooden door

Slimelings can be equipped by their owners with a Slimeling Inventory Bag to transport items.

To complete this quest get any one of the eggs - note you may need a Heavy Duty Pickaxe.ANDpreRequ1429GalacticraftMars/item.spaceshipTier2~0tasksORretrievalGalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~01retrievalGalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~11retrievalGalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~21rewardschoiceGalacticraftMars/item.null~41minecraft/boat~08minecraft/cooked_fished~08minecraft/gunpowder~016minecraft/gold_ingot~08minecraft/repeater~04minecraft/wooden_door~04enhancedlootbags/lootbag~71itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSurvivorII~02dreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~02
