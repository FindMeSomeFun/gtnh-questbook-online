1471SlimelingThe Slimeling is a utility mob that spawns from Slimeling Eggs found on the surface of Mars. It shares some features from vanilla wolves and mules: it can be tamed and attacks mobs that threaten its owners, and can be equipped with a special chest to transport items.

As an allied mob, Slimelings will actively help and follow the player-owner and will attempt to protect them. They can also have a neutral behavior, that is, they can attack if provoked or hurt by non-owners.

Items that you can feed Slimelings with:

Boat
Cooked fish
Gunpowder
Gold ingot
Redstone repeater
Wooden door

Slimelings can be equipped by their owners with a Slimeling Inventory Bag to transport items.

To complete this quest get any one of the eggs - note you may need a Heavy Duty Pickaxe.ANDpreRequGalacticraftMars/item.spaceshipTier2~0Quest Name For 14291429rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~7Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name2tasksORRetrievalGalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~0GalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~0 Name1RetrievalGalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~1GalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~1 Name1RetrievalGalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~2GalacticraftMars/tile.slimelingEgg~2 Name1
