1568Attuned StoneAn attuned stone is a diamond that has been infused with natural magic in a fiery medium. Attuned stones can be used to link non-magical devices to the magical currents present in the world, and are one of the main ingredients in crafting distilleries, kettles, altar foci and poppet shelves.

The other main use of attuned stones is to act as a portable power source for circle magic rites, when a nearby altar is not available. To act in such a way, the attuned stone must first be charged with a Rite of Charging.AND1558witchery/ingredient~34ANDoptional_retrievalminecraft/lava_bucket~01retrievalwitchery/ingredient~101itemwitchery/ingredient~278itemdreamcraft/item.CoinWitch~025dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizard~025
