If you didn't get it from Wintry bees already, Majestic bees have a very important attribute - high fertility. They will leave 4 drones when they die. This means lots of genetic material for the next generation to work with.

Majestic bees produce dripping combs every 1.5 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time.ANDpre11180Forestry/beeQueenGE-0-Noble.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-25.pngLootBag (Bees Basic);You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
