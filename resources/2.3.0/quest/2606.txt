You then craft those into Imprint Supporting Boards in an Autoclave in a Cleanroom with Soldering Alloy. Unfortunately, there's only a 75% chance of succeeding, so I had you collect extra materials. You can use the leftovers for your next imprint.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~2059Quest Name For 26032603bartworks/gt.bwMetaGenerateddust~4Quest Name For 26042604bartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedgemExquisite~35Quest Name For 26052605rewardstasksANDOptionalbartworks/gt.bwMetaGenerateddust~36bartworks/gt.bwMetaGenerateddust~36 Name18Optionalbartworks/gt.bwMetaGenerateddust~34bartworks/gt.bwMetaGenerateddust~34 Name72Optionalbartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedItem0~2bartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedItem0~2 Name18Retrievalbartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedItem0~3bartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedItem0~3 Name8
