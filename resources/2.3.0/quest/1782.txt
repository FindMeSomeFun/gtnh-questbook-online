1782Traveller's Goggles UpgradesNightvision is very useful. If you combine your Goggles with a night vision potion (3:00, make sure to make 3 at a time), a golden carrot, and a lighter inside the Tinkers Crafting Station you get Night Vison Goggles. Place the Goggles in the Center of the Crafting Station.

Hint:
Autorepair can be added to the goggles as well.
