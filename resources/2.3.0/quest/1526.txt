1526§9§k§r§9§m§l§r§m§n§o§r§9§lBest Crossbow?Energetic alloy has proven to be an amazing material.  It's light weight and high stiffness makes it perfect for a crossbow limb. It is slightly slower to draw but still has amazing stopping power with its very high bolt speed. Durability is much improved over a carbon limb. 

The material would also make an excellent bolt body. Perhaps you will find a suitable tip to match?AND990gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11366ANDretrievalTGregworks/tGregToolPartCrossbowLimb~16351itemminecraft/spawn_egg~541minecraft/spawn_egg~511minecraft/spawn_egg~521itemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~61dreamcraft/item.CoinSmithI~05
