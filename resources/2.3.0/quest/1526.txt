It's light weight and high stiffness makes it perfect for a crossbow limb. It is slightly slower to draw but still has amazing stopping power with its very high bolt speed. Durability is much improved over a carbon limb. 

The material would also make an excellent bolt body. Perhaps you will find a suitable tip to match?ANDpre9901gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11366.pngrewardsItemminecraft/spawn_egg-54.pngSpawn Zombie
