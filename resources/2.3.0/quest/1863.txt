To use, rightclick the item filter you get as a reward. Put the things you want voided in the item filter list by clicking in there with them. Esc, then rightclick the voiding drop filter, and put the item filter inside.ANDpre971gregtech/gt.blockmachines-211.pngrewardsItemberriespp/BppPotions-8.pngReal Bottled J\u00e4germeister!
