TwilightForest/item.knightlyHelm-0.pngAnd I Dub Thee Sir KnightNeed an infinite source of knightmetal? It will be a hard plant to grow. Make sure you provide plenty of nutrients, clean air, fertilizer and water. Don't cry to me if it dies. Any oreberry is a good source crop, with Cobalt and Ardite best, then iron and the rest.0-1ANDpre18070TwilightForest/item.steeleafIngot-0.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.blockmetal4-0.pngBlock of Knightmetal
