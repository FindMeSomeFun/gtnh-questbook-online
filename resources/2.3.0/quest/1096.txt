1096Scribing ToolTo unlock research you need a scribing tool and paper. To do the research, you need a scribing tool and the research note you made in the research table, so you should probably make two tools.

Note: Thaumcraft Research Tweaks has reworked the research table GUI. Aspects are now combined with drag & drop between aspects in the GUI. You can also right-click while dragging the aspect instead of dropping; the same works with the hexes. All the new features are described in your Thaumonomicon, make sure to checkout the 'Research', 'Research Expertise', 'Research Mastery' and 'Research Duplication' pages.ANDpreRequ226Thaumcraft/ItemThaumometer~0tasksANDretrievalThaumcraft/blockTable~02retrievalminecraft/paper~016rewardsitemminecraft/paper~064Thaumcraft/ItemLootBag~01itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~05
