1096Scribing ToolTo unlock research you need a scribing tool and paper. To do the research, you need a scribing tool and the research note you made in the research table, so you should probably make two tools.

Note: Thaumcraft Research Tweaks has reworked the research table GUI. Aspects are now combined with drag & drop between aspects in the GUI. You can also right-click while dragging the aspect instead of dropping; the same works with the hexes. All the new features are described in your Thaumonomicon, make sure to checkout the 'Research', 'Research Expertise', 'Research Mastery' and 'Research Duplication' pages.ANDpreRequThaumcraft/ItemThaumometer~0Quest Name For 226226rewardsItemThaumcraft/ItemLootBag~0Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalThaumcraft/blockTable~0Thaumcraft/blockTable~0 Name2Retrievalminecraft/paper~0minecraft/paper~0 Name16
