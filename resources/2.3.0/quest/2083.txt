Start by getting a Treealyzer, and scan the vanilla trees. They will transform into the forestry versions. You will need to gather honey or honeydew drops from bee combs to power the Treealyzer. 

If you want to bulk scan saplings, you can feed them through a GT scanner filled with honey.

You can also try the Genetics mod to modify them. It's on the first bee tab.ANDpre1031gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11019.png5780Forestry/factory-1.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-19.pngLootBag;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
