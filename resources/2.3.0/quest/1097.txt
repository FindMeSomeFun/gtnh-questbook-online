You will feel relieved a bit after bathing.AND1055WarpTheory/item.warptheory.paper~0ANDretrievalThaumcraft/ItemBathSalts~02itemThaumcraft/ItemEssence~12Thaumcraft/ItemEssence~12Thaumcraft/ItemEssence~12Thaumcraft/ItemEssence~12Thaumcraft/ItemLootBag~11itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~05
