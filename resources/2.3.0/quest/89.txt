gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1121.png§6§lMV Steam TurbineHaving moved up to MV, you can continue using Steam. However, it's not a great idea to stay here, and other fuel types will be more useful to you instead. This is because Steam Turbine efficiency drops quickly with every tier (this one is only 75%), and the Steam itself needs big pipes to carry it around, compared to Benzene or Diesel.

That said, if you want to keep using this, then it's a good idea to build a Large Bronze Boiler or, later on, a Large Steel Boiler. You will need lots of solid fuel, probably Charcoal, so make sure you automate it! Definitely do not forget the water.0-1ANDpre18671gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32601.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-5.pngLootBag\nYou feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...\nEnchant with a Fortune III Book
