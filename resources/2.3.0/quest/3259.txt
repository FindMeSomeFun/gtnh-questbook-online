The solegnolia is your solution to that. Simply place one down anywhere you don't want items to be automatically put in your inventory, and the ring of magnetization will be disabled while you're in the vicinity of the solegnolia. It doesn't even require mana!ANDpre32581Botania/lexicon-0.pngrewardsItemBotania/mushroom-12.pngBrown Shimmering Mushroom
