1982What's Behind Door #3?The Malisis door factory lets you go crazy with all kinds of ideas for custom doors.

A player sensor is a nicer way of opening a door, instead of pushing a button or stepping on a plate...bit unforunate about the ingredients though. 

Maybe you can find a use for this block mixer, it's kinda weird and doesn't work right. I was going to throw it out anyways.

There are some craftable Malisis items as well, check them out in NEI.AND91gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32630ANDretrievalmalisisdoors/player_sensor~01itemmalisisdoors/block_mixer~01
