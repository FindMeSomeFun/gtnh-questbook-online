1295Perfecting Crystal GrowthThe crystal growth chamber is used for fast crystal growth, and it is possible to increase its speed by installing acceleration cards in an upgrade slot. It works more like a normal device, with the crystals growing in its internal inventory. Unlike the more primitive versions, it doesn't use power when not in use. It also doesn't use a channel.ANDpreRequ1294appliedenergistics2/tile.BlockQuartzGrowthAccelerator~0tasksANDretrievalae2stuff/Grower~01rewardschoiceappliedenergistics2/item.ItemCrystalSeed~064appliedenergistics2/item.ItemCrystalSeed~60064appliedenergistics2/item.ItemCrystalSeed~120064enhancedlootbags/lootbag~381itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~02
