1295Perfecting Crystal GrowthThe crystal growth chamber is used for fast crystal growth, and it is possible to increase its speed by installing acceleration cards in an upgrade slot. It works more like a normal device, with the crystals growing in its internal inventory. Unlike the more primitive versions, it doesn't use power when not in use. It also doesn't use a channel.ANDpreRequappliedenergistics2/tile.BlockQuartzGrowthAccelerator~0Quest Name For 12941294rewardsChoiceappliedenergistics2/item.ItemCrystalSeed~0Choice Name64appliedenergistics2/item.ItemCrystalSeed~600Choice Name64appliedenergistics2/item.ItemCrystalSeed~1200Choice Name64enhancedlootbags/lootbag~38Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name2tasksANDRetrievalae2stuff/Grower~0ae2stuff/Grower~0 Name1
