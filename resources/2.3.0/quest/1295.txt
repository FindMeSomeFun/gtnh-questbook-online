ae2stuff/Grower-0.pngPerfecting Crystal GrowthThe crystal growth chamber is used for fast crystal growth, and it is possible to increase its speed by installing acceleration cards in an upgrade slot. It works more like a normal device, with the crystals growing in its internal inventory. Unlike the more primitive versions, it doesn't use power when not in use. It also doesn't use a channel.0-1ANDpre12940appliedenergistics2/tile.BlockQuartzGrowthAccelerator-0.pngrewardsChoiceappliedenergistics2/item.ItemCrystalSeed-0.pngCertus Quartz Seed\nThis item won''t de-spawn.\n0.0%
