404Kill DemonDemons are powerful, evil beings who dwell in the infernal dimensions. To date, none have been seen roaming the Nether, where their minions: ghasts, blazes and their ilk seem to dominate. To meet a demon without a way to protect oneself is almost certain death. They are known to hit like a proverbial truck, and require a significant amount of damage to kill. Some demons have even been seen shooting fireballs! They are, of course, also immune to fire.ANDpreRequ345witchery/seepingshoes~0tasksANDhuntwitchery.demon1rewardsitemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~551itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSurvivorIII~01dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardIII~01dreamcraft/item.CoinAdventureIII~01
