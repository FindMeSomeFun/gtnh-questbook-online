40§2§lYou Shall ProceedAs you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.

§5§5As a special reward you get a pair of Holo Glasses to look inside your inventories. Place it into the mask slot, and use the keybind to turn it on. Sometimes it gets turned off somehow, so try pressing the button if that happens.ANDpreRequ35gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~230036gregtech/gt.metatool.01~161738openglasses/openglasses~7734tasksANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~173005optional_retrievaldreamcraft/item.WoodenBrickForm~01optional_retrievaldreamcraft/item.UnfiredClayBrick~08optional_retrievalminecraft/brick~08optional_retrievalminecraft/brick_block~02optional_retrievalIC2/blockMachine~11craftinggregtech/gt.blockmachines~1001rewardschoicegregtech/gt.blockmachines~51216enhancedlootbags/lootbag~11itemholoinventory/Hologlasses~01itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~020
