2714bartworks/BioLabModules-4.png0Actually Copying Cultures11-1To copy a culture, you'll need
1) A Sterilized Petri Dish
2) A Plasma Membrane (made from Stemcells, or gotten while making EnzymesSollution)
3) Stemcells
4) A Data Orb with the appropriate data on it
5) Liquid DNA
6) A LuV Bio Lab
7) A Clonal Cellular Synthesis Module

You can change out the Data Orb for one with whatever culture you wish to copy. Keep in mind that it might be easier to make a second culture the normal way, and that there's generally an alternative recipe that uses the fluid it produces to make it with a higher chance.

PS: This recipe is the only one in NEI that uses this module, so you can find it if you look, but the number will change, so I can't specify which page.ANDpre27130bartworks/BioLabModules-1.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalbartworks/BioLabParts-0.pngSterilized Petri Dish
