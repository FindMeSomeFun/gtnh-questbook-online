BTW the other recipe that makes this is used later in the processing chain. You can loop the 2-Ethylanthraquinone so you don't have to make more if you don't want to scale up.

You need Palladium for the next quest.ANDpre26920miscutils/itemDustPhthalicAnhydride-0.pngrewardstasksANDOptionalmiscutils/itemDustPhthalicAnhydride-0.pngPhthalic Anhydride Dust;C\u2086H\u2084(CO)\u2082O
