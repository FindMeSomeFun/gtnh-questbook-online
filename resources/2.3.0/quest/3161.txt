3161Sparge TowerThis is the last structure of the LFTR chain, and the only one gated after the Assembly Line. The best LFTR fuel, Fuel 3, is locked after this, and a lot of useful byproducts are only obtainable here as well, so it's important that you build this if you have a working LFTR.

The structure itself is very similar to a Distillation Tower, but with different blocks. The controller is the most expensive part, but the biggest obstacle is having the Assembly Line; everything after that shouldn't be too difficult. It's recommended that you have more than one tower, but for one focus on making only one. 

Note: the height of this tower is not adjustable. It is meant to be a 3x8x3 multiblock with at least 45 Sparge Tower Casings.ORpreRequmiscutils/itemCellThoriumBerylliumDepletedMoltenSaltTBSalt~0Quest Name For 31603160gregtech/gt.blockmachines~31034Quest Name For 31783178rewardstasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~31035gregtech/gt.blockmachines~31035 Name1miscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5~4miscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5~4 Name54Retrievalmiscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5~4miscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5~4 Name1
