1726Rocket Tier 5After a month of hard work and ten thousand stacks of iTNT your fifth rocket is finally ready.

You need to use CN3H7O3 (Purple) Rocket Fuel or better to fuel it.

ยง3If you started on an older version of GTNH and still have some Monomethylhydrazine Fuel Mix, you can also use that as rocket fuel!
