Data Access Hatch: It holds 4 data sticks, so 4 recipes.

Advanced Data Access Hatch: It holds 16 data sticks. Ironically, you can make this right away.

Automatable Data Access Hatch: It's UV, but it allows I/O of the sticks. Skip it.

The Data Bank Multi: Can be connected to multiple Asslines, and can contain more than 1 DAH. This is the best way, when you can do it. Look in ZPM for the quest.

You only need to make one.ANDpre14121gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1170.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32708.pngData Stick;A Low Capacity Data Storage
