103gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11019.png1Getting Ready for Tier 2, MV4-1In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, 8 is enough to complete this quest.

Your first option is alumina dust. Probably the best source for alumina is clay or hardened clay from canyons, however you need an MV machine for that, so you need to find an alternative until you have enough dust for your initial setup. For now, you can get it by centrifuging various impure piles from your ores or by smelting ruby, sapphire, or green sapphire in an EBF with carbon. Check the EBF quest in the Multiblock Goals.

You will also need an EBF to turn the alumina into aluminium ingots. For that you need cryolite. Go visit the Twilight Forest for that and find a Galena vein.

Your second option is to use aluminium dust. However, you can not smelt that directly yet, even if you have an EBF. That will require higher heat levels. For now, you will have to either use a Tinker's Smeltery or a GT Compressor to turn the dust into raw aluminium which you can then smelt into ingots in the EBF. Check out the Tier 0 quest for some options to obtain the dust. 

By the time you've completed this, you'll probably be done with most of the tab, but you'll still need Good Circuits (MV) to actually open up the next tier if you haven't done that yet.

Also check the Armor and Jetpacks tab for new unlocks.
Note: If you were exploring Twilight Forest before 2.1.1.4 you won't find any cryolite in existing veins. You'll need to explore new chunks.
