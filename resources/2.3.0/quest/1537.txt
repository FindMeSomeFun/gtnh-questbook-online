gregtech/gt.metatool.01-120-Neutronium-Neutronium.png§§§5§lBlack and DeckerTired of having to replace tools all the time? Now that steel is available, it's time to make some electric versions of the screwdriver and wrench! Charge them up like a battery, and they'll last much longer than normal versions of the tools.

You can use lithium batteries, or if you're on a budget, cadmium or sodium batteries instead. Later on, Vibrant Alloy will make excellent tools with great durability.
