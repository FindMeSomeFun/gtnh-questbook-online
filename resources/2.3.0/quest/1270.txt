1270Time for a SpadeThis item is a combined Weeding Trowel, Hoe and Shovel. If you're the type that accidentally does things, only use this when necessary, as it's easy to mess up and use it to harvest/destroy your crops when you wanted to get rid of a weed.

You can use it to get seeds from crops when they're §9immature§r using §6right-click§r at very low rates. Using §4left-click§r when §9immature§r will result in nothing.

If it's §amature§r, use §6left-click§r to have a higher chance of a seed dropping. Using §4right-click§r when §amature§r will result in lower seed drops than punching it normally.

Keep in mind that the higher the tier/stats of the crop, the lower the chances. By a lot.

§3The formula is 1+tanh((-1)(X+5((-Re/2)+Gr+Ga)/21)/12); X=0 to 16

Where Re, Gr, Ga are respectively Resistance, Growth and Gain stat of the crop, and X is tier. Don't ask me whether this is for L/R-click, ask bart or look at the code.ANDpreRequIC2/itemWeed~0Quest Name For 724724gregtech/gt.blockmachines~222Quest Name For 10811081rewardsChoiceIC2/itemCropSeed~0Choice Name1tasksANDRetrievalberriespp/itemSpade~0berriespp/itemSpade~0 Name1
