1270berriespp/itemSpade-0.png0Time for a Spade13-1This item is a combined Weeding Trowel, Hoe and Shovel. If you're the type that accidentally does things, only use this when necessary, as it's easy to mess up and use it to harvest/destroy your crops when you wanted to get rid of a weed.

You can use it to get seeds from crops when they're immature using right-click at very low rates. Using left-click when immature will result in nothing.

If it's mature, use left-click to have a higher chance of a seed dropping. Using right-click when mature will result in lower seed drops than punching it normally.

Keep in mind that the higher the tier/stats of the crop, the lower the chances. By a lot.

The formula is 1+tanh((-1)(X+5((-Re/2)+Gr+Ga)/21)/12); X=0 to 16

Where Re, Gr, Ga are respectively Resistance, Growth and Gain stat of the crop, and X is tier. Don't ask me whether this is for L/R-click, ask bart or look at the code.ANDpre7240IC2/itemWeed-0.png10811gregtech/gt.blockmachines-222.pngrewardsChoiceIC2/itemCropSeed-0.pngWhite Stonelilly Seeds;Gr 1;Ga 1;Re 1
