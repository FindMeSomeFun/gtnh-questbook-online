They can be found in the largest Hollow Hills, Labyrinths, and in Dark Towers. Pinch Beetles charge at you and grab your body. When in this situation you want to quickly attack and kill them. They are very fast and can be extremely dangerous when near lava, a cliff, or other enemies. Pinch beetles can suffocate you if the ceiling is too low.ANDpre2251minecraft/end_portal-0.pngrewardsItembetterquesting/extra_life-2.pngQuarter Heart
