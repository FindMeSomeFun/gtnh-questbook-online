3043§b§lMonaziteWelcome to lanthanide processing!
It'll be a fun journey, whether you like it or not :P

First off get some monazite. This is only to get you started,
as you're going to need a §oton§o§o§r to truly reap the rewards
of this line.

You'll then need to combine it with nitric acid in the Digester multiblock,
to get its mud form.
Yes, this is a §overy§r nitric acid hungry process!ANDpreRequ213gregtech/gt.blockmachines~153041gregtech/gt.blockmachines~10500tasksANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~3065321retrievalbartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedcell~1101412rewardsitemdreamcraft/item.CoinChemistIII~01
