Cultivated bees have the shorest lifespan - this means they make great princesses to breed with your newly bred drones. The queen will die quickly, quickly giving genetic material to work with. Make sure the traits you want are kept!

They are also a Fast production bee, which means lots of honey combs for powering your Beealyzer or Treealyzer. 

Cultivated Bees produce Honey Combs every 0.9 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time.

Make sure your cultivated bees are pure with a Beealyzer or GT scanner.

The main bee breeding quests will require pure bees but you can use Ignoble or Pristine princesses.ANDpre11170Forestry/beeQueenGE-0-Common.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-25.pngLootBag (Bees Basic;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
