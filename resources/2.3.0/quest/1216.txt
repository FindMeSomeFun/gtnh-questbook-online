1216Peat Fired EnginePeat fired engines use Peat or Bituminous Peat to run. Peat burns for 5000 ticks and produces 10 RF every tick, 1 peat makes 0.66 Ash, so you get 2 Ash for burning 3 peat. Bituminous Peat burns for 6000 ticks and produces 20 RF/tick.

Peat Farms can be setup by using a managed farm with tin electron tubes. It is possible with a manual farm too.ANDpreRequ577Forestry/sturdyMachine~0tasksANDoptional_retrievalminecraft/piston~01retrievalForestry/engine~11rewardschoiceForestry/peat~016Forestry/bituminousPeat~08enhancedlootbags/lootbag~191itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~015dreamcraft/item.CoinForestry~015
