1536§3§lI Ain't Afraid of no Ghost!I've found a use for the Ectoplasm you can collect from spirits of the dead. It makes a very useful glass that you can walk on, but mobs cannot. However, they think they can! 

So you can use this to create a moat around your base that drops mobs to the death in various ways, or just to shuttle them off somewhere else. Separate babies from mothers? Use it in a mob farm? Capture pigmen walking into the Overworld from you Nether portal? So many possibilities!ANDpreRequ52minecraft/glass~0tasksANDoptional_retrievalminecraft/glass~08retrievalRandomThings/spectreGlass~016rewardschoiceminecraft/glass~016enhancedlootbags/lootbag~21harvestcraft/stuffedeggplantItem~03itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~015dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizard~015
