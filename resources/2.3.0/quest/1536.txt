1536§3§lI Ain't Afraid of no Ghost!I've found a use for the Ectoplasm you can collect from spirits of the dead. It makes a very useful glass that you can walk on, but mobs cannot. However, they think they can! 

So you can use this to create a moat around your base that drops mobs to the death in various ways, or just to shuttle them off somewhere else. Separate babies from mothers? Use it in a mob farm? Capture pigmen walking into the Overworld from you Nether portal? So many possibilities!ANDpreRequminecraft/glass~0Quest Name For 5252rewardsChoiceharvestcraft/stuffedeggplantItem~0Choice Name3Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizard~0Item Name15tasksANDOptionalminecraft/glass~0minecraft/glass~0 Name8RetrievalRandomThings/spectreGlass~0RandomThings/spectreGlass~0 Name16
