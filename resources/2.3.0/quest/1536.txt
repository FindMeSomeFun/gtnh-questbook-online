So you can use this to create a moat around your base that drops mobs to the death in various ways, or just to shuttle them off somewhere else. Separate babies from mothers? Use it in a mob farm? Capture pigmen walking into the Overworld from you Nether portal? So many possibilities!ANDpre521minecraft/glass-0.pngrewardsChoiceminecraft/glass-0.pngGlass;Glass-Tier: HV
