3143Quantum ChestplateYou can make a Quantum Chestplate as well. You can fly with it, but the hover mode is not great and it is a lot slower than the Advanced NanoChestPlate because it doesn't have a boost mode. What you really want is the GraviChestPlate but that is ZPM-tier. Alternatively you can make a magic infused chestplate.AND803IC2/itemArmorQuantumHelmet~1ANDoptional_retrievaldreamcraft/item.IridiumAlloyItemCasing~08optional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~273164retrievalIC2/itemArmorQuantumChestplate~327671choicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01~326042IC2/itemPartIridium~04enhancedlootbags/lootbag~81itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~05
