3280gregtech/gt.metaitem.03-4129.png0Nano Forge Tier 212-1Carbon Nanites are good first worker, but they don't have much in the way of working with more complex systems as they have a very basic nanite network. So a new more advanced nanite will be needed to produce complex nanites.

The neutronium nanite is an in-between of the two tiers able to produce tier 2 nanites, which have other uses.

ยง3When putting the neutronium nanite in the controller, you will need to wait for the structure check to happen again or break and replace the controller with a neutronium nanite inside. Allows the Nano Forge to make tier 2 nanites.ANDpre4581miscutils/MU-metaitem.01-32105.png32790gregtech/gt.metaitem.03-4010.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03-4129.pngNeutronium Nanites;Nt
