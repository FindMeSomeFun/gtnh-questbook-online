There are many other ways of obtaining hydrogen which you might want to look into. Some are only available much later.

Examples are: chemical processing or electrolysis of methane obtained from organic sources, electrolysis of water or salt water, mixing sodium with water, or eventually siphoning hydrogen directly from a gas giant.ANDpre5391gregtech/gt.blockmachines-361.pngrewardsItemminecraft/mushroom_stew-0.pngMushroom Stew
