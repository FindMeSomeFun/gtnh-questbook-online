This multi gets a significant discount to EU/t when upgrading the coils, but it caps at HSS-S, at a maximum of 50% discount. If you are still using low-tier coils, this is a great time to upgrade them to Nichrome and enjoy a 30% discount. You could also do TPV.

By the way, you can wall-share Oil Crackers, just like DTs, LCRs and many other multis, and doing this will save on the amount of coils you need!

You only need to do one of the two tasks.ANDpre30100gregtech/gt.blockmachines-142.pngrewardsItemIC2/itemCellEmpty-0.pngEmpty Cell
