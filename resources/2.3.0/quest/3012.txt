3012Improved Oil CrackerHave you built an Oil Cracker? Have you checked its coils? This multi gets a significant discount to EU/t when upgrading the coils, but it caps at HSS-S, at a maximum of 50% discount. If you are still using low-tier coils, this is a great time to upgrade them to Nichrome and enjoy a 30% discount. You could also do TPV.

By the way, you can wall-share Oil Crackers, just like DTs, LCRs and many other multis, and doing this will save on the amount of coils you need!
