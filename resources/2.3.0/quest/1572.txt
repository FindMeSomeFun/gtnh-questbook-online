1572Nightmare ProtectionThe Dream Weaver of Nightmares has two effects, firstly it will add a short weakness effect to a player when they wake up from a good nights sleep. Secondly, it will corrupt all other nearby dream weavers so that they have the opposite effect. If the dream weaver is itself corrupted by another nearby Dream Weaver of Nightmares, it will add a short blindness effect instead of nausea.

The Dream Weaver of Nightmares can also be used to fend off nightmares when a Brew of Sleeping is drunk. Having the Dream Weaver nearby will reduce the chance of a nightmare to 50 percent (this can be decreased further by other means!).ANDpreRequ1570witchery/ingredient~1011574witchery/ingredient~29tasksANDoptional_retrievalwitchery/ingredient~291retrievalwitchery/ingredient~61rewardsitemwitchery/ingredient~998enhancedlootbags/lootbag~541itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSurvivorII~01dreamcraft/item.CoinWitchII~01dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardII~01
