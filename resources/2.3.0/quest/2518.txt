Put a filled cell (or other item) in the bottom left to have the contents deposited into the network, and the cell moved to the output slot. For the reverse, select a fluid and insert an empty cell, and it'll fill it.ANDpreRequappliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiPart~380Quest Name For 185185rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~37Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalae2fc/part_fluid_terminal~0ae2fc/part_fluid_terminal~0 Name1
