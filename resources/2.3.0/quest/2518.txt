2518The Fluid TerminalThe ME Fluid Terminal allows you to directly input and output fluids from the network using buckets, cells, and other fluid-containing items. Put a filled cell (or other item) in the bottom left to have the contents deposited into the network, and the cell moved to the output slot. For the reverse, select a fluid and insert an empty cell, and it'll fill it.ANDpreRequ185appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiPart~380tasksANDretrievalae2fc/part_fluid_terminal~01rewardsitemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~371itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~01
