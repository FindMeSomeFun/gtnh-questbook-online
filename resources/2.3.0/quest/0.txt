0minecraft/wheat-0.png1Your First Night0-1Your first task will be to find food, and a shelter for the night. The nights will be cruel, as this pack has hardcore darkness. It probably would be a good idea to collect some food now...

Note: You don't need to keep this book, you can use tilde to open quests without the book. ...if your keybinds don't conflict.

Go to the Discord server at https://discord.gg/EXshrPV for help outside of what the questbook offers, or just to hang out. Select an appropriate role in #role-select to get tier-appropriate advice.

We also maintain a wiki at https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page be sure to check it out. Some of the stuff is really complicated, and needs more text to explain than the QB can do. Also, pictures. Also, beginner's guides for some stuff if you don't think the questbook is enough. There's also a list of optional mods for people that want to be even fancier, or use different fonts or w/e.

Additionally, there's the spreadsheet at http://bit.ly/gtnh-datasheets for info that you would would want a spreadsheet for.

Lastly, if you got the pack from Curse, please be aware that it doesn't always work properly (Curse doesn't play well with all the customized versions of mods we have), so if you have any problems, the first response on how to fix it will be to switch to another launcher like MultiMC or Technic. The latest version is available on the discord channel from #announcements or with the !download command.
