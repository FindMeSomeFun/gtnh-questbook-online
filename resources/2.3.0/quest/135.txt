While holding it, you are able to switch between conduit types, eventually allowing you to remove one specific conduit type from a bundle of many. Ctrl-Mousewheel will switch modes, also Shift-Leftclick allows you to open the configuration interface even if you don't have access to that side of the conduit.ANDpreRequ134EnderIO/itemPowerConduit~0tasksANDretrievalEnderIO/itemYetaWrench~01rewardsitemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~51itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~025
