Now that you've made dark steel you can get reinforced obsidian which is wither-proof. Useful for manual killing and even automation once you get a powered spawner supplying you with wither skeleton skulls.

Hint: Unlike vanilla obsidian, reinforced obsidian CAN be moved by pistons which might come in handy.ANDpre1380EnderIO/itemAlloy-6.pngrewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag-5.pngLootBag (Tier 2 MV)
