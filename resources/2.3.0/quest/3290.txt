3290Tier 2 TransformingAfter a significant amount of progression, you will be able to build the tier 2 QFT by replacing 2 of its casings, the ones on the exterior shell, by the ones listed in this quest. When finished, the multi will be able to perform the monaline skip and a two out of three naqline skips. Amidst all the expensive materials, there is one that can only be crafted in a t1 QFT, so I hope you've got it going.

The first item - Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. This adhesive is very effective at sticking things together, but it is also quantum-stable, which means that it cannot be altered or damaged by simple quantum fields. On top of that, it also has self-healing properties, which means that it can tolerate the increased energy flow of a tier 2, 3 or 4 QFT by repairing itself even when damaged, regardless of how that damage is applied.ANDpreRequ3288TaintedMagic/ItemFocusVisShard~03289Avaritia/Resource~5tasksANDretrievalmiscutils/item.BasicGenericChemItem~221rewards
