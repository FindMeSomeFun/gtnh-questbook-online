You'll need to use a circuit to pick which of the products you want. Later on you can make a Distillation Tower to get all of them, but that's far away for now.

You can also distill many other fluids! There are two that are useful, but take a long time to distill, so you should set them up in advance: Lubricant (from Creosote) and Distilled Water (from Water).1-1ORpre931gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32610.png5461BuildCraftEnergy/blockOil-0.pngrewardsChoiceIC2/itemCellEmpty-0.pngEmpty Cell
