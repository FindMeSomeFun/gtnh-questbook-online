1440Oxygen Bubble DistributerThe Oxygen Bubble Distributor takes oxygen from the Oxygen Collector, and makes an oxygen bubble providing an area to safely breathe in without needing Oxygen Gear. The bubble is a sphere surrounding the distributor and will go through walls (or any block). Alternatively, you can use an Oxygen Sealer (which needs compressed Desh Plates) to contain oxygen inside a room.AND810GalacticraftCore/item.spaceship~0ANDoptional_retrievalGalacticraftCore/item.airFan~02retrievalGalacticraftCore/tile.distributor~01choiceGalacticraftCore/tile.oxygenPipe~06minecraft/leaves~0512enhancedlootbags/lootbag~61itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~01
