3278PCB Factory Tier 3Why use a small nosel to print out the conductor on the board when one can just build it using nanites? Well the silver nanite isn't rigid enough for that so a new nanite will be needed... and so will new casings. Heard that celestial tungsten is a good candidate for a frame. Quantum can be used for the protection as these nanites will be forever flying around inside.

The structure will need to change as it needs to be a bit bigger and taller.

ยง3Works the same as the Tier 2 in most cases, but allows the player to use even less resources by using a gold nanite.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32017Quest Name For 32373237gregtech/gt.blockcasings8~12Quest Name For 32763276rewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03~4086gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~4086 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockcasings8~13gregtech/gt.blockcasings8~13 Name1gregtech/gt.blockcasings8~10gregtech/gt.blockcasings8~10 Name1
