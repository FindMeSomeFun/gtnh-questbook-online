Well the silver nanite isn't rigid enough for that so a new nanite will be needed... and so will new casings. Heard that celestial tungsten is a good candidate for a frame. Quantum can be used for the protection as these nanites will be forever flying around inside.

The structure will need to change as it needs to be a bit bigger and taller.

Works the same as the Tier 2 in most cases, but allows the player to use even less resources by using a gold nanite.ANDpre32371gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32017.png32760gregtech/gt.blockcasings8-12.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03-4086.pngGold Nanites;Au
