2959Naquadah Fuel RefineryThis insane machine is used to make MkIII and higher tier naquadah fuel.

It can't be overclocked by increasing the input voltage. The only way to overclock it is to use higher tier coils.

It also supports §9Tec§1Tech§r's Multi-Amp energy hatches and laser hatches.

Example: The MkIV fuel requires tier 2 coils and the refinery is using tier 3 coils. This gives an overclock similar to fusion, using 2x power and 0.5x time.ANDpreRequ2948gregtech/gt.blockmachines~12732tasksANDoptional_retrievalGoodGenerator/fieldRestrictingGlass~08retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~169991rewardsitembartworks/gt.bwMetaGeneratedcell~100461
