Getting the Mica for the heating coils might be a little tricky...but you can use a substitute for the first tier of coils.

§4(You need 2 LV hatches with 4A of 32V total, or 3 LV hatches with MOOOORE power if the multiblock is not fully repaired)

§rA few recipes produce CO2/SO2 as fluid. You can put an output fluid hatch to the top layer of the EBF to collect it otherwise it gets auto voided. It depends on the muffler hatch how much fluid you can recover. Bart's Platinum Series recipes output fluids on the BOTTOM, so if you want to do Platinum Stuff later, remember that.

Moron always says - Make Muffler Moint Mup. Or point up, anyways.

If you want a really fancy EBF, you can add more input fluid hatches and store different fluids in each one.

The EBF also has a heat adjustment of 100K for each power tier above or below MV. You can only make LV energy hatches right now, but installing two LV energy hatches will overclock the EBF to MV power, eliminating the 100K penalty and setting the initial heat to 1801K.

As you upgrade your EBF over the course of the game, this heat adjustment will increase. Two MV energy hatches (overclocking to HV) will add +100K, two HV energy hatches (overclocking to EV) will give +200K, and so on. Coils only set the base value.

This adjustment does not apply to the Volcanus.

§4If the pollution gets really bad, check in GT++ Multiblocks for a pollution scrubber, or upgrade your Muffler.
