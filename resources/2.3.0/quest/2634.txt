ToxicEverglades/everglades.trigger-0.pngA Vision of the Future (FPS Drop Not Included)To get to the Toxic Everglades, you'll need 10 Containment Frames and an Alkalus Disk (Activated).  You use them like when making a nether portal. The disk can also be used to set special fires. It doesn't spread across the ground that well, but it'll take out a tree real fast. If you want to get rid of a giant tree, this is your tool.

The dim itself is filled with GT++ ores. If you want the ore distribution to make sense/be greggy, badger Alk about it.0-1ANDpre26271gregtech/gt.blockmachines-47.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalToxicEverglades/blockDarkWorldPortalFrame-0.pngContainment Frame\nUse this to access the Toxic Everglades.\nAssembled in the same shape as the Nether Portal.
