2856structurelib/item.structurelib.constructableTrigger-0.png0Advanced MB Construction17-1The ability to rotate MBs and view a structure hologram has been sto-borrowed from TecTech, giving you greater freedom to build the way you want! (until we nerf wallsharing at least)

Unlike TT, you can use a normal wrench for this, just aim at the front center of a controller (or one of the other sides if you want to. You just need to aim for the part of the grid with the mark) and right click or shift-right-click. The first rotates it clockwise, the latter flips it. If you want to change the facing of the controller itself, do that the normal way.

Use a Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector or MSHP to visualize the structure, pay attention to the bottom left for structure details. For multiblocks that accept multiple types of tiered components or have a variable size, the number of MSHPs you hold in your hand will decide which tier is shown in the hologram.

If you don't get it, try placing a controller, wrenching it, and using the MSHP on it.

While it's now possible to build a sideways EBF, or even build one into the floor, not everything can be rotated. Exceptions include: LSC, Charcoal Pile Igniter, BBF, DT, Miners, Industial Washing Plant, Algae Farm, Bacterial Vat, DEHP, the MVF can, but the MBF cannot.

PS: We did get permission, that was just a little joke.ANDpre771gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1000.pngrewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag-4.pngLootBag (Tier 1 LV)
