2856§6§lAdvanced MB ConstructionThe ability to rotate MBs and view a structure hologram has been sto-§oborrowed§r from §9Tec§1Tech§r, giving you greater freedom to build the way you want! §5(until we nerf wallsharing at least)§r

Unlike TT, you can use a normal wrench for this, just aim at the front center of a controller (or one of the other sides if you want to. You just need to aim for the part of the grid with the mark) and right click or shift-right-click. The first rotates it clockwise, the latter flips it. If you want to change the facing of the controller itself, do that the normal way.

Use a Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector or MSHP to visualize the structure, pay attention to the bottom left for structure details. For multiblocks that accept multiple types of tiered components or have a variable size, the number of MSHPs you hold in your hand will decide which tier is shown in the hologram.

§3If you don't get it, try placing a controller, wrenching it, and using the MSHP on it.§r

While it's now possible to build a sideways EBF, or even build one into the floor, not everything can be rotated. Exceptions include: LSC, Charcoal Pile Igniter, BBF, DT, Miners, Industial Washing Plant, Algae Farm, Bacterial Vat, DEHP, the MVF can, but the MBF cannot.

§3PS: We did get permission, that was just a little joke.ANDpreRequ77gregtech/gt.blockmachines~1000tasksANDretrievalstructurelib/item.structurelib.constructableTrigger~01rewardschoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~41gregtech/gt.metatool.01~161itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~025
