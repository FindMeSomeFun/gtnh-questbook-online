661§5§lBow, Arrows and QuiverWow, your first handmade §oehm§r machine made bow. You find out that you can put the bow in the mine and blade battlegears slots. Now it's time to make a quiver and maybe some arrows. 

To place arrows in the quiver, put the quiver and the stack of arrows in a crafting grid. Make sure the Gameplay key Special is deconflicted. By default it is Z. When you have the bow selected, use Z to swap arrow slots in the quiver.

While it seems like these might be worthless, these arrows do have special uses. You really want to share a cookie with friends, don't you?
