For Tungstate, you can centrifuge previously macerated moon dust, macerate end stone with an HV+ macerator and then centrifuge it, or centrifuge endergoo (found all over the end, does not give back buckets).

If you want to make your rocket, you need to get at least a little before you can get to a planet with the ore. However, keep in mind that you'll need an EBF with TPV Coils to smelt Tungstensteel Dust into the ingot!
