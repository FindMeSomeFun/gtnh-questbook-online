3026Breaking the MoldWelcome, o' Baron of Oil. For you who has completed the 5 questlines of oil processing, a new chapter awaits you.

The following quests are not guidelines on how to work with oil. In reality, they are meant for tiers where you're not supposed to be using this kind of power anymore. However, if you do want to continue it, and push it as far as it can go, the following are a few challenges that you can take on, mostly for bragging rights.

All these challenges are for the tiers after IV. Some of them are for LuV, others need further progression. Good luck!ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30677Quest Name For 29942994gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30708Quest Name For 29992999gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30709Quest Name For 30093009gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30998Quest Name For 30193019gregtech/gt.blockmachines~1023Quest Name For 30253025rewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30707Item Name256tasksANDCheckboxcheckbox 
