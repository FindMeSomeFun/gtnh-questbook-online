478§3§lFlint and SteelAfter you make steel you are able to craft flint and steel. I guess you'll want to travel to the Nether as soon as possible but be aware; the Nether is a very dangerous place.

Note: The ball of moss gives a tinker's tool self-repair. But if the tool is completely broken, it won't repair it.

Note that the flint and steel can take a few times to work.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11305Quest Name For 6565rewardsItemTConstruct/materials~6Item Name1Choiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~2Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name15tasksANDOptionalminecraft/flint~0minecraft/flint~0 Name1Optionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.02~20305gregtech/gt.metaitem.02~20305 Name1Craftingminecraft/flint_and_steel~0minecraft/flint_and_steel~0 Name1
