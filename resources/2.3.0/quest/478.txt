478minecraft/flint_and_steel-0.png1Flint and Steel3-1After you make steel you are able to craft flint and steel. I guess you'll want to travel to the Nether as soon as possible but be aware; the Nether is a very dangerous place.

Note: The ball of moss gives a tinker's tool self-repair. But if the tool is completely broken, it won't repair it.

Note that the flint and steel can take a few times to work.ANDpre651gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11305.pngrewardsItemminecraft/bow-0.pngBow;Durability: 384/384
