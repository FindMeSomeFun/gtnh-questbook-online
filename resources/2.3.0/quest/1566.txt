1566Early Bird Gets the...Nightmare?You woke up very early because of the nightmares following you in the dream world.

You weren't prepared for it, so let get some stuff together first and enter a second time to get some wispy/disturbed cotton.

If you haven't unlocked your Brewing stand yet, you have to do it first. Look in the Novice Thaumaturge tab for the quest.ANDpreRequminecraft/end_portal~0Quest Name For 15641564rewardsItemAWWayofTime/alchemyFlask~6Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinWitchI~0Item Name5dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalwitchery/ingredient~78witchery/ingredient~78 Name4minecraft/potion~8198minecraft/potion~8198 Name4
