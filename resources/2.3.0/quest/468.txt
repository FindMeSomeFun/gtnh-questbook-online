468A Digital SingularityWhat? You filled up the Quantum storage cell? I hope with something better than Cobblestone. Anyway, you better make something EVEN bigger then.

Hmm, adding even more storage capacity to a single cell would result in something so dense in information that it would just collapse into a singularity. So why not be smart about it. Just use an already existing singularity! Build a sturdy casing around it and some connecting components and you should be good. Better use an eternal singularity though to make sure things remain stable.


§3The Digital Singularity can store more than 4 quintillion items. If you manage to fill one up, please contact the dev team so that they can ban you for cheating, ... eh I mean §ocongratulate you on your achievement§r§3, of course!AND466appliedenergistics2/item.ItemExtremeStorageCell.Quantum~02582Avaritia/Resource_Block~12665gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32120ANDretrievalappliedenergistics2/item.ItemExtremeStorageCell.Singularity~01itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianIII~02
