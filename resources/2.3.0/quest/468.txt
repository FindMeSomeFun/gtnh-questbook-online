Hmm, adding even more storage capacity to a single cell would result in something so dense in information that it would just collapse into a singularity. So why not be smart about it. Just use an already existing singularity! Build a sturdy casing around it and some connecting components and you should be good. Better use an eternal singularity though to make sure things remain stable.
