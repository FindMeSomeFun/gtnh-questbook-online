1791§5§lOilsand, or How You Get Heavy OilOilsand is another way to get heavy oil. Maybe you got lucky and found some in a mountainous biome. With your centrifuge you're able to get heavy oil and sand out of the ore. The veins can be found between Y 50-80.

Sadly, you can't use heavy oil until MV, so just stick them in a barrel or something until then.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~361Quest Name For 539539rewardsItemharvestcraft/carrotsoupItem~0Item Name1ChoiceIC2/itemCellEmpty~0Choice Name16Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinAdventure~0Item Name15tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockores~878gregtech/gt.blockores~878 Name256
