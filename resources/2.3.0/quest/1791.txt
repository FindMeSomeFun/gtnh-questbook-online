1791§5§lOilsand, or How You Get Heavy OilOilsand is another way to get heavy oil. Maybe you got lucky and found some in a mountainous biome. With your centrifuge you're able to get heavy oil and sand out of the ore. The veins can be found between Y 50-80.

Sadly, you can't use heavy oil until MV, so just stick them in a barrel or something until then.ANDpreRequ539gregtech/gt.blockmachines~361tasksANDretrievalgregtech/gt.blockores~878256rewardsitemNatura/berryMedley~016harvestcraft/strawberrypieItem~02harvestcraft/carrotsoupItem~01choiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~21IC2/itemCellEmpty~016itemdreamcraft/item.CoinAdventure~015
