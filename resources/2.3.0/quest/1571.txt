1571DistilleryA distillery used by a witch is a construct used for distilling magical ingredients. It is unlike a normal distillery, because it heats itself using energy obtained from a nearby altar. The distillery must be within about 14 - 16 blocks of an altar to draw power from it - a small icon is shown in the interface if no power is available.

One or two ingredients are distilled together and will result in up to four resulting materials. A supply of clay jars is also needed to capture the some or all of the distillates.

A distillery is crafted using Iron Ingots, Gold Ingots, an Attuned Stone and Clay jars.ANDpreRequ335witchery/spinningwheel~0tasksANDretrievalwitchery/distilleryidle~01rewardsitemwitchery/ingredient~2764enhancedlootbags/lootbag~541itemdreamcraft/item.CoinWitchII~01dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardII~01
