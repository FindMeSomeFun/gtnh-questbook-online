That said, it's very simple to generate power from plasma, a one-step process of having a Plasma Turbine. These special turbines only work with plasma and are significantly more expensive than the previous ones, requiring Tungstensteel for the body and Naquadah + Naquadah Alloy for the controller.

First, how much plasma can one tier 1 reactor produce? The best option for power at this stage is Helium Plasma, with its cheap inputs, and this takes 6.4 seconds per bucket to generate. Since a bucket is worth 81,920,000 EU, that equates to 640,000 EU/t at 100% efficiency or 960,000 EU/t at 150%. That is almost 8 ZPM amps, a massive power spike compared to the powergen available before this, with almost no processing before the plasma! For most players, fusion is the only source of power for 3 or 4 tiers, and all other ways of getting power are much more complicated and harder to upscale.

That said, you will still need multiple turbines to actually consume all of the plasma. At LuV, each turbine can only output the equivalent of 1 ZPM amp, so you will need high-efficiency turbines that don't go above the value of 131,072 EU/t output. Three candidates, in descending order of efficiency, are: Large Rhodium-Palladium at 150% and 124,740 EU/t, Normal Draconium at 145% and 121,800 EU/t and Large Tungstencarbide at 140% and 123,480 EU/t.ANDpre31520gregtech/gt.blockcasings5-13.pngrewardstasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockmachines-1153.pngLarge Plasma Generator;Machine Type: Plasma Turbine;Controller block for the Large Plasma Generator;Needs a Turbine, place inside controller;Use your Fusion Reactor to produce the Plasma;-----------------------------------------;Hold [LSHIFT] to display structure guidelines;Added by: Gregtech
