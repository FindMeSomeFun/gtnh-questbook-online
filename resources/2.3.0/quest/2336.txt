Mutandis Extremis has all the same properties as basic Mutandis but it can even be used on multi-stage plants like wheat, cactus, etc. and can also mutate cooked meat.

If Mutandis Extremis is used on a Grass block there is a chance it will mutate it into Mycelium and vice versa.

If Mutandis Extremis is used on an underwater dirt block there is a chance it will mutate it (and nearby dirt) into clay blocks.

Mutating plants is the only way to acquire Rowan, Hawthorn and Alder saplings.
