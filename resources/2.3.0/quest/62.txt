Fill it with water on the bottom side to produce steam. Unlike the other boilers, this only outputs steam on the output port side.

§4Hint: The solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time. Later on you can consider using distilled water to avoid calcification.

§3You'll need silver from the Twilight Forest (LV+) or from small ores for this.ANDpre521minecraft/glass-0.png590gregtech/gt.GregTech_FluidDisplay-89.pngrewardsItemharvestcraft/papayajellysandwichItem-0.pngPapaya Jelly Sandwich\nharvestcraft:papayajellysandwichItem
