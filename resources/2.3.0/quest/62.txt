Fill it with water on the bottom side to produce steam. Unlike the other boilers, this only outputs steam on the output port side.

Hint: The solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time. Later on you can consider using distilled water to avoid calcification.

You'll need silver from the Twilight Forest (LV+) or from small ores for this.ANDpre521minecraft/glass-0.png590gregtech/gt.GregTech_FluidDisplay-89.pngrewardsItemharvestcraft/papayajellysandwichItem-0.pngPapaya Jelly Sandwich
