62§3§lThe Power of the SunThe sun has quite a bit of power, so why not use it to produce steam? 

Fill it with water on the bottom side to produce steam. Unlike the other boilers, this only outputs steam on the output port side.

§4Hint: The solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time. Later on you can consider using distilled water to avoid calcification.

§3You'll need silver from the Twilight Forest (LV+) or from small ores for this.ANDpreRequminecraft/glass~0Quest Name For 5252gregtech/gt.GregTech_FluidDisplay~89Quest Name For 5959rewardsItemharvestcraft/papayajellysandwichItem~0Item Name2Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name10tasksANDCraftinggregtech/gt.blockmachines~105gregtech/gt.blockmachines~105 Name1
