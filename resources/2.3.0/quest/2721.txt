Coal (1600BT) + 1800t -> Coal Coke (3200BT) +500l Cr
Wood Log (300BT) + 1800t -> Charcoal (1600BT) + 250l Cr
Cactus (50BT) + 500t -> Cactus Charcoal (400BT) +30l Cr
Cactus Charcoal (400BT) + 500t -> Cactus Coke (800BT) +30l Cr
Sugar Cane (50BT) + 500t -> Sugar Charcoal (400BT) +30l Cr
Sugar Charcoal (400BT) + 500t -> Sugar Coke (800BT) +30l Cr

You'll want Coke for making steel in your BBF later on. Though you can still use charcoal if you want.AND27minecraft/coal~1ANDretrievalminecraft/reeds~08retrievalmiscutils/itemSugarCharcoal~08retrievalmiscutils/itemSugarCoke~08itemmiscutils/itemCactusCoke~04miscutils/itemSugarCoke~04enhancedlootbags/lootbag~11itemdreamcraft/item.CoinFarmer~05
