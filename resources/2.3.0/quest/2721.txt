Railcraft/fuel.coke-0.png§2§lPersonally, I Prefer Pepsi™You may have noticed that you can make more than just Charcoal in a Coke Oven, you can also make Coke. But which kinds are better?

Coal (1600BT) + 1800t -> Coal Coke (3200BT) +500l Cr
Wood Log (300BT) + 1800t -> Charcoal (1600BT) + 250l Cr
Cactus (50BT) + 500t -> Cactus Charcoal (400BT) +30l Cr
Cactus Charcoal (400BT) + 500t -> Cactus Coke (800BT) +30l Cr
Sugar Cane (50BT) + 500t -> Sugar Charcoal (400BT) +30l Cr
Sugar Charcoal (400BT) + 500t -> Sugar Coke (800BT) +30l Cr

You'll want Coke for making steel in your BBF later on. Though you can still use charcoal if you want.0-1ANDpre271minecraft/coal-1.pngrewardsItemmiscutils/itemCactusCoke-0.pngCactus Coke\nUsed for smelting.\nBurn Time: 800
