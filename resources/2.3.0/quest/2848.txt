§3You only need to make one.

§rAlso keep in mind that the energy storage ones can have EU put in, if you just wanna charge, unlike the solars (also the solar wind ones don't work for some reason). The higher tier ones charge faster (advanced solars just point at the sun to get 100% power during daylight instead of only at noonish, but hybrids are indeed faster. Also hybrids don't crash the game just by placing them anymore!)ANDpre17320GalaxySpace/item.spacesuit_jetplate-0.pngrewardsChoiceGalacticraftCore/tile.machineTiered-0.pngEnergy Storage Modul
