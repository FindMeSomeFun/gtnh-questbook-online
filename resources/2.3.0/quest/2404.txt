Or you can get cruel, and stuff one into a smeltery to melt it down into delicious Liquid Ender and cast pearls from it.

You monster.

Some of the dungeons have Spawner of Enderman, so you can do whatever you want with it.

To prevent endermen from teleporting make sure to cover the smeltery so they don't see the sky. If you manage to put a regenerating endermen in there, tag it so it doesn't despawn, and make sure your smeltery is not in a claimed chunk on a server.ANDpre740TConstruct/Smeltery-0.pngrewardsChoiceminecraft/ender_pearl-0.pngEnder Pearl
