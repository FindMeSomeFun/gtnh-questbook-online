minecraft/ender_pearl-0.png§e§d§c§6§lObtaining Ender PearlsYou can hunt endermen the Vanilla way to get a chance at Ender Pearls, you can purchase Endermen spawn eggs, or try your luck in the End. 

Or you can get cruel, and stuff one into a smeltery to melt it down into delicious Liquid Ender and cast pearls from it.

You monster.

Some of the dungeons have Spawner of Enderman, so you can do whatever you want with it.

§cTo prevent endermen from teleporting make sure to cover the smeltery so they don't see the sky. If you manage to put a regenerating endermen in there, tag it so it doesn't despawn, and make sure your smeltery is not in a claimed chunk on a server.0-1ANDpre740TConstruct/Smeltery-0.pngrewardsChoiceminecraft/ender_pearl-0.pngEnder Pearl\n1H Chunkloader Use in Passive and 4H in Personal Chunkloader
