This list is subject to change due to balancing at any time!

Example:

Tier X:
Dimension/Planet
Fluid <Number that represents how likely it is for this fluid to show up> <Number that represents how much can be present in any 8x8 UF chunk. They are 0-# unless otherwise specified>
Other fluid that is also present <same as above> <same as above>
Etc
