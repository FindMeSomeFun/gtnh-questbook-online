AWWayofTime/masterStone-0.pngWell of SufferingThe Well of Suffering damages mobs in a 6 block radius and feeds blood gained from them into an altar that is also within 6 blocks. Each mob costs 2 LP to damage, but give 10LP back. You can use Runes of Sacrifice to increase this. Very useful for automation!0-1ANDpre7120AWWayofTime/itemRitualDiviner-1.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalAWWayofTime/masterStone-0.pngMaster Ritual Stone
