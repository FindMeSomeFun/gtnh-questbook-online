The resulting device can neither hold a focus nor be placed in a crafting table, but it can still be used to activate constructs, or as a "vis battery" for Repair-enchanted equipment or Runic shielding.ANDpreRequThaumcraft/WandRod~50Quest Name For 878878rewardsItemThaumcraft/ItemLootBag~2Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardII~0Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalThaumcraft/ItemResource~15Thaumcraft/ItemResource~15 Name1
