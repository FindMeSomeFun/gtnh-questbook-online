§3You need IV circuits and the HV assembler to start the tab though.

§6If you're doing the no-rocket run, hold a stack of Titanium Ingots to proceed. Same thing for Tungstensteel when you get to EV.ANDpre12311gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32652.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-22.pngLootBag;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
