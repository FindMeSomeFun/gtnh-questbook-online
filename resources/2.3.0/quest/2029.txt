The "effective" voltage for the High Current Arc furnace is one tier lower than the energy hatch. For example, with an MV tier energy hatch, it will do LV tier arc furnace recipes.

This machine also does plasma arc furnace recipes.

ยง3This multi is LuV. It also uses Thorium 232 and is generally a huge pain to make, considering how not useful it is.ANDpre14161gregtech/gt.blockmachines-810.png14931gregtech/gt.blockmachines-16.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-8.pngLootBag\nYou feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...\nEnchant with a Fortune III Book
