26§2§lForming Press v0.1As you may have noticed, you cannot turn clay into bricks directly. Well, to be fair, it wasn't a good recipe anyway. You'll probably end up with something bread-shaped.

It's as easy as that.AND33TConstruct/ToolStationBlock~1ANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metatool.01~341retrievaldreamcraft/item.WoodenBrickForm~01itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~010
