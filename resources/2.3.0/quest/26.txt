dreamcraft/item.WoodenBrickForm-0.png§2§lForming Press v0.1As you may have noticed, you cannot turn clay into bricks directly. Well, to be fair, it wasn't a good recipe anyway. You'll probably end up with something bread-shaped. So in order to make bricks, you need a form. Get yourself a knife (flint above a stick) and a blank pattern, and cut a brick sized piece out. It's as easy as that.1-1ANDpre331TConstruct/ToolStationBlock-1.pngrewardsItemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician-0.pngCoin "The Technician 1"
