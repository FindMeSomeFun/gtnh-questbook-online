Effectively, it's a Steam Boiler that uses fluids instead of solids, but it's more complicated. The two main sources of energy here are Lava and Hot Coolant, and the second is more powerful, but harder to get. Lava can be automated from Everburn Urns or a myriad of other option, while Hot Coolant usually requires a proper powergen setup.

For Lava, the LHE will output 160 L of Steam for every 1 L of Lava, up to 1000 L/s of Lava input (4000 EU/t at 100% turbine efficiency). For Hot Coolant, the LHE will output 400 L of Steam for every 1 L of Hot Coolant, up to 800 L/s of input (8000 EU/t at 100% turbine efficiency).

If you go above these input rates, the output becomes Superheated Steam, which needs to pass through a Large HP Steam Turbine before the regular Large Steam Turbine. The maximum input rate here is twice of what was before, the conversion is 1:80 for Lava and 1:200 for Hot Coolant, and the energy output at 100% turbine efficiency is 12000 EU/t for Lava and 24000 EU/t for Hot Coolant.

Very powerful, but complicated, and needs turbines!
