Once you've duplicated it, you can combine the 2 Fortune I books in an anvil to get a Fortune II. Duplicate the Fortune II books to get a Fortune III! 

With a Fortune III book and a tier-specific item you can remove the trash item rewards from your loot bags. More good stuff!

Soulbound is another good enchantment, it will keep an enchanted item in your inventory in case of death.ANDpre19130BiblioCraft/Printing Press-0.pngrewardsItemminecraft/enchanted_book-0.pngEnchanted Book\nFortune I\nHold the Sneak key for Enchantment Description
