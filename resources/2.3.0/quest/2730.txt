This goes 32/64/96/128/256+ and continues from there. They're also so powerful that only a few machines support them outside of the ever §owonderful§r TecTech: LSC, MEBF, MVF. and PSS. (Might be added in the future!) Remember to color both the Laser Vacuum Pipes, and the Source and Target Hatches. Also, Source = Output, Target = Input.

Laser Converters are basically: Laser Source (on machine) -> Vacuum Pipes -> LC -> 5x output split into X amps, 32 for the first. Make sure to put it into recieve mode. Or do it the other way around if you want to go up, it's basically a transformer that converts laser to/from cables. You can also use them to turn the lasers if you don't mind 3x the loss on device output (and not sending all the amps) compared to the Active Transformer (because of loss on each output). Just remember to put a battery buffer in between if you want it to work.

§3You can use the Low Power Laser Pipes if using a 'Low Power' Hatch or Converter, but keep in mind you'll need to connect them with wire cutters yourself after coloring them.

§cBe careful with using very high ampere hatches as every Laser Hatch has 1EU/s per max. ampere passive power loss.ANDpre20061tectech/gt.blockcasingsTT-0.pngrewardstasksANDCheckboxcheckbox-.pngCheckbox
