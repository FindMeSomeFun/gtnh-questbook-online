3051§b§lWe Ain't Running a Farm!...What's this low-purity hafnium stuff?

Well, because you of course want your hafnium to be of the highest quality, you're going to have to do a little more than just EBF it with a little magnesium.

Go ahead and react it with some Iodine. If you're not too sure where to get Iodine, have a look at Seaweed Ash. (hint: you'll need to look at small piles)

Note that both the liquid and dust forms of iodine are optional, so you can complete the quest with one. Or none!
