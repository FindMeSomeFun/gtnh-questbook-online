1542Crop AutomationThe Crop-Matron is a LV machine that will monitor crops in a 11x11x3 area and automatically apply fertilizer, Weed-EX, and Water as needed. Water can be pumped in directly or use IC2 Universal water cells, normal cells aren't returned when they're used.

The Crop-Matron is rainproof, but make sure you cover up your power supply (you might find a fancy way to do this), or use an LV battery.  A Lithium Ion will last about 2 hours. 

Tilled dirt still requires a nearby water block to be hydrated as the Matron will only water the crop, not the soil. Try putting a lily pad on top so it isn't annoying to walk on, or using Garden Soil instead.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11019Quest Name For 103103Natura/N Crops~0Quest Name For 721721rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~51Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinFarmer~0Item Name30tasksANDOptionalIC2/itemPartCircuit~0IC2/itemPartCircuit~0 Name2RetrievalIC2/blockMachine2~2IC2/blockMachine2~2 Name1
