1542Crop AutomationThe Crop-Matron is a LV machine that will monitor crops in a 11x11x3 area and automatically apply fertilizer, Weed-EX, and Water as needed. Water can be pumped in directly or use IC2 Universal water cells, normal cells aren't returned when they're used.

The Crop-Matron is rainproof, but make sure you cover up your power supply (you might find a fancy way to do this), or use an LV battery.  A Lithium Ion will last about 2 hours. 

Tilled dirt still requires a nearby water block to be hydrated as the Matron will only water the crop, not the soil. Try putting a lily pad on top so it isn't annoying to walk on, or using Garden Soil instead.ANDpreRequ103gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~11019721Natura/N Crops~0tasksANDoptional_retrievalIC2/itemPartCircuit~02retrievalIC2/blockMachine2~21rewardschoiceIC2/itemWeedEx~016IC2/itemFertilizer~016enhancedlootbags/lootbag~511itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~030dreamcraft/item.CoinFarmer~030
