This is not a problem anymore. Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Item Pipeline block. Inbetween use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.

To actually connect it, you need to align the start LDIP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDIPP block. Put a conveyor on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import stuff to the endpoint LDIP. §2This will go as fast as you can put items into it.§r

Do the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a conveyor.

Now you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the items will be "teleported" to you.

Of course, later on you'll probably use ender chests to §oactually§r teleport the ore, especially from other dims.

This setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.ANDpre9300gregtech/gt.blockmachines-679.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32630.pngConveyor Module;1 stack every 20 secs (as Cover)
