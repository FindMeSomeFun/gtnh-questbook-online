The Bacterial Vat can be found in the Multibock Goals tab. You can use it right now if you have any industrial brewing needs or wait until later when you need to get into bioengineering.

If you are only doing this later you might as well make a higher tier Bio Lab. You only need one of them to complete the quest.ANDpre18141gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-17473.png25651gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-17636.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.03-32022.pngPetri Dish
