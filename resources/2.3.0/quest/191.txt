191Standard Nuclear Fuel: UraniumJust "regular" uranium fuel, nothing special about it. It produces 5x the power, and 4x the heat of thorium, while lasting 2/5 the time.

Most fuel rods are basically this, but slightly modified. You generally get this from Mars and it's moons, but you can get a little from centrifuging thorium if you want.

BTW, one of the reactor types 'pulses' the reactor to turn it off once it gets too hot. You can pack in the rods and then cool it off for a while to get higher efficiency out of each rod. Try it if you like explosions.ANDpreRequIC2/blockGenerator~5Quest Name For 190190rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~7Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.reactorUraniumSimple~0gregtech/gt.reactorUraniumSimple~0 Name1
