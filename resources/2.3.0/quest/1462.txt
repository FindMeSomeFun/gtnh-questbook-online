1462Thermal ClothThermal Padding is a set of garments made out of an advanced insulating material. The garments are able to keep a player from freezing to death in the cold environments of Outer Space. They are also able to keep the player from suffering heat exhaustion in an overly hot environment.

The temperature indicator on the Life Support HUD will show if the player is becoming too hot or too cold - as the temperature approaches dangerous levels, an "Invalid Thermal Protection" warning will be shown. On Mars and the Asteroids, simply wearing a full set of Thermal Padding should be enough to fix this.
