Thaumcraft/WandCasting-8.pngA Wizard's Staff Has a Knob on the EndJoin the core with two wand caps, a twilight forest mob drop, and screws just as for making a wand. A staff cannot be used for crafting, but holds 2.5x as much vis as a corresponding wand. It can even serve as a backup weapon for melee. While it cannot receive weapon enchantments, its damage is decent, and it does not take damage with use (no durability bar).0-1ANDpre8780Thaumcraft/WandRod-50.pngrewardsItemThaumcraft/WandRod-2.pngSilverwood Rod
