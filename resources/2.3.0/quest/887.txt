887A Wizard's Staff Has a Knob on the EndJoin the core with two wand caps, a twilight forest mob drop, and screws just as for making a wand. A staff cannot be used for crafting, but holds 2.5x as much vis as a corresponding wand. It can even serve as a backup weapon for melee. While it cannot receive weapon enchantments, its damage is decent, and it does not take damage with use (no durability bar).ANDpreRequThaumcraft/WandRod~50Quest Name For 878878rewardsItemThaumcraft/WandRod~2Item Name2Thaumcraft/ItemLootBag~2Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardII~0Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalThaumcraft/WandRod~50Thaumcraft/WandRod~50 Name1Thaumcraft/WandCap~0Thaumcraft/WandCap~0 Name2dreamcraft/item.LichBone~0dreamcraft/item.LichBone~0 Name2gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~27366gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~27366 Name4
