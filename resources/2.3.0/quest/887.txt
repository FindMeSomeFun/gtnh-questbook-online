887A Wizard's Staff Has a Knob on the EndJoin the core with two wand caps, a twilight forest mob drop, and screws just as for making a wand. A staff cannot be used for crafting, but holds 2.5x as much vis as a corresponding wand. It can even serve as a backup weapon for melee. While it cannot receive weapon enchantments, its damage is decent, and it does not take damage with use (no durability bar).ANDpreRequ878Thaumcraft/WandRod~50tasksANDretrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~273664rewardsitemThaumcraft/WandRod~22Thaumcraft/ItemLootBag~21itemdreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizardII~01
