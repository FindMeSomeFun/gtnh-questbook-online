2828It's 'Super' Heated SteamSo that means it produces §otwice§r as much power! You can get this steam through the LHE, the SOFC Mk II or the Titanium/Tungstensteel Boilers. It gets converted to normal steam as the output at a 1:1 ratio, so make sure to have a non-HP one to take advantage of that. In total, a HP Steam Turbine and a regular one combined produce 3x the EU with Superheated Steam that normal Steam would produce.AND160gregtech/gt.blockmachines~13ANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~611retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~11521itemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~71itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~06
