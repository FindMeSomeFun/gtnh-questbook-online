You can get this steam through the LHE, the SOFC Mk II or the Titanium/Tungstensteel Boilers. It gets converted to normal steam as the output at a 1:1 ratio, so make sure to have a non-HP one to take advantage of that. In total, a HP Steam Turbine and a regular one combined produce 3x the EU with Superheated Steam that normal Steam would produce.ANDpre1601gregtech/gt.blockmachines-13.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-7.pngLootBag (Tier 4 EV);You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
