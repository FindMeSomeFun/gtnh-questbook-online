2828It's 'Super' Heated SteamSo that means it produces §otwice§r as much power! You can get this steam through the LHE, the SOFC Mk II or the Titanium/Tungstensteel Boilers. It gets converted to normal steam as the output at a 1:1 ratio, so make sure to have a non-HP one to take advantage of that. In total, a HP Steam Turbine and a regular one combined produce 3x the EU with Superheated Steam that normal Steam would produce.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~13Quest Name For 160160rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~7Item Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name6tasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockcasings4~11gregtech/gt.blockcasings4~11 Name29gregtech/gt.blockmachines~51gregtech/gt.blockmachines~51 Name1gregtech/gt.blockmachines~61gregtech/gt.blockmachines~61 Name1Retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~1152gregtech/gt.blockmachines~1152 Name1
