1117Breed some common beesTo cross breed bees you need two different species of bees. One drone and one princess from different world-gen hives (Meadows and Forestry as an example)

Bee Houses do not allow crossbreeding. You need an Apiary to crossbreed them to a new species. Certain frames will help this process. Shortening their lifespan means faster crosses. Increasing Mutation rate means getting mutations and thus rare bees quicker.

Common Bees produce Honey Combs every 2.2 minutes. Note that production times are an approximation based on the bee's base production speed and the product's rarity. They do not reflect actual production time. 

Make sure your bees are pure by checking their genetics with a Beealyzer or GT scanner.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metatool.01~28Quest Name For 500500rewardsItemForestry/beeCombs~0Item Name16Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinBees~0Item Name25tasksANDOptionalForestry/beePrincessGE~0Forestry/beePrincessGE~0 Name1RetrievalForestry/beeDroneGE~0Forestry/beeDroneGE~0 Name1
