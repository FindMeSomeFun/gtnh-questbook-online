Unfortunately, you have to load and unload them using a machine's interface (like ULV tanks for example), but hey, 512 buckets in a single slot is pretty good!

§3In case it wasn't clear, you cannot use these directly in the world, like with BC tanks, or dumping the fluid on the ground.ANDpre1051gregtech/gt.blockmachines-221.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32405.pngLarge Steel Fluid Cell\nNo Fluids Contained\n0L / 8,000L
