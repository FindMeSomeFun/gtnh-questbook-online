To get Neutronium, go to one of the planets that has the small ores. Then mix it with Helium Plasma to make Raw Neutronium Dust. It can be smelted in a Blast Furnace at 9000K and 491,520 EU/t. This recipe takes a long time and a lot of power. Better make another EBF or Volcanus. Or a few. Or upgrade your Mega Blast Furnace.ANDpre26271gregtech/gt.blockmachines-47.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11129.pngNeutronium Ingot;Nt
