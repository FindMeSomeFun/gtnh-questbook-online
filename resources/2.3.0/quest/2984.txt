gregtech/gt.blockmachines-531.pngSimple DistillationAs rich as Oil is, it's hardly useful for anything in this state. One of the most important parts in the processing chain is distillation, which separates the components of this black mixture from their difference in density, or how "heavy" they are. You can do this in a Distillery, starting in LV, but only one of the fractions can be obtained at a time: you must choose which one you want.

Lighter fractions are generally more useful than heavier ones, but that doesn't mean that lightest is best. For now, going for Sulfuric Light Fuel is the best option, since it will become a good source of power after being treated. Don't use the Oil to power these machines, stick to Steam until you can use something better.
