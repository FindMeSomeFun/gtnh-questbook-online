765§6§lTime to Drill for Oil!Pumps are nice but you're going to reach a point where you'll want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE oil. This multiblock will help with that but you'll need to search for oil using a seismic prospector. You can find raw, light, medium, and heavy oil. There's also a chance to find natural gas.

Higher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. 

Later you can upgrade the oil drilling rig so it extracts from more than one chunk at a time.

You need mining pipes in the controller. If you need more than 64, you can use an input bus.

These are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on any side. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!

Space dims can also have fluids beneath bedrock.
