TConstruct/SpeedBlock-0.pngTinker's BlocksTinker's Construct offers a couple of useful blocks from the smeltery. Rough Brownstone takes Tin and Gravel and makes a block that lets you move a little faster. Cobblestone can be turned into Seared Stone, usable in the smeltery walls to make it larger without having to use clay.0-1ANDpre740TConstruct/Smeltery-0.pngrewardsItemminecraft/lava_bucket-0.pngLava Bucket\nBurn Time: 20000\nYou need Gloves for it?
