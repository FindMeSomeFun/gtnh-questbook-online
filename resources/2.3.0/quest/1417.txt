The detector's setting can be changed by clicking on the +/- texture with a screwdriver. Also, in general, better (and larger) turbines work better at cleaning up pollution. The code is too complex to fully explain here, but that's basically it. More EU turbine = more pollution cleaning turbine.

This quest covers one method of combating pollution - there are others, including not making as much to begin with.ANDpre14940gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1000.pngrewardsChoicemiscutils/itemAirFilter-0.pngAir Filter [Tier 1]
