1555Mutate Your SaplingsMutandis is a mutagen that is used by witches and warlocks to mutate plants into other species. Simply use Mutandis on small plants, grass, flowers, saplings, etc. and it will be randomly converted to another plant. Mutandis cannot mutate multi-stage plants like wheat and cactus.

Mutating plants is the only way to acquire Rowan, Hawthorn and Alder saplings.

Mutandis has another interesting property when crafted with raw meat. It seems to mutate it into another type of raw meat. It even seems to have an effect on Rotten Flesh.

Some recipes require Mutandis as an ingredient.

Mutandis can be upgraded to Mutandis Extremis to have an effect on a wider variety of plants.

Mutandis is made in a Witches' Cauldron using Mandrake Root, Exhale of the Horned One and an Egg.ANDpreRequwitchery/cauldron~0Quest Name For 334334rewardsItemminecraft/glass_bottle~0Item Name16witchery/ingredient~27Item Name16Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinCook~0Item Name25dreamcraft/item.CoinWitch~0Item Name25dreamcraft/item.CoinDarkWizard~0Item Name25tasksANDOptionalminecraft/egg~0minecraft/egg~0 Name8witchery/ingredient~22witchery/ingredient~22 Name8witchery/ingredient~31witchery/ingredient~31 Name8Retrievalwitchery/ingredient~14witchery/ingredient~14 Name48
