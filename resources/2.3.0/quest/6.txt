6§1§lYou Reap...You won't always get food rewards from this book, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem. As you've created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field.  With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.

To get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You'll get Witchery seeds too, save those for later. Start planting a cotton field, it's a key early game resource.

§3PS: You can also grab a bunch from villages, and also grow the seeds from Pam's garden food.AND5gregtech/gt.metatool.01~2ANDretrievalminecraft/stick~08itemminecraft/carrot~05
