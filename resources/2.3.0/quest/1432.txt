1432Mars LanderThe Mars lander is required for a soft landing. Put the Moon lander on a Parachute and surround it with airbags - that will do the trick. You hope.

Hint: Sometimes you can't loot or break the lander. Try to retrieve the contents with a hopper underneath. To prevent this, make sure to wait until you come to a full and complete stop, like when at a stop sign. Everyone does that, right?AND1427GalacticraftMars/item.null~3ANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~290864retrievalGalaxySpace/item.ModuleLander2~01choiceGalacticraftCore/item.basicItem~68GalacticraftCore/item.basicItem~98GalacticraftCore/item.basicItem~118enhancedlootbags/lootbag~71itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSpaceII~02dreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~02
