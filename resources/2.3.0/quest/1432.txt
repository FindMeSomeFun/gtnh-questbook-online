1432Mars LanderThe Mars lander is required for a soft landing. Put the Moon lander on a Parachute and surround it with airbags - that will do the trick. You hope.

Hint: Sometimes you can't loot or break the lander. Try to retrieve the contents with a hopper underneath. To prevent this, make sure to wait until you come to a full and complete stop, like when at a stop sign. Everyone does that, right?ANDpreRequGalacticraftMars/item.null~3Quest Name For 14271427rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~7Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name2tasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~29086gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~29086 Name4RetrievalGalaxySpace/item.ModuleLander2~0GalaxySpace/item.ModuleLander2~0 Name1
