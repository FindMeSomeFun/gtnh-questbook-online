3028gregtech/gt.blockmachines-866.png0Hyperheated Steam21-1If there is someone who found themselves invested in the Large Tungstensteel Boilers, this one is for you. Through the pollution, the multiblock spamming and the chained processing lines you need to get here, you will find that this is a lot of heat for one boiler to handle. Why not make two quad boilers?

You might be thinking about the number of turbine multis you need to withstand this, but fret not! There are extra large turbines, for the extra large steam enthusiast. You will need twelve turbine items for each multi, and you best bring the best ones you can make! Loose mode is up to you, just go wild with your super fuel.

ยง4You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest.ยงrANDpre30260witchery/brewgas-0.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines-1023.pngLarge Tungstensteel Boiler\nMachine Type: Boiler\nController block for the Large TungstenSteel Boiler\nProduces 32,000L of Superheated Steam with 1 Coal at 213,333L/s\nA programmed circuit in the main block throttles the boiler (-1000L/s per config)\nOnly some solid fuels are allowed (check the NEI Large Boiler tab for details)\nIf there are any disallowed fuels in the input bus, the boiler won''t run!\nDiesel fuels have 1/4 efficiency - Takes 125 seconds to heat up\nCauses: 4000 pollution per second\n-----------------------------------------\nHold [LSHIFT] to display structure guidelines\nAdded by: Gregtech
