2405Wax On, Wax OffYou can take vanilla tree saplings and place them directly on crop sticks. This will give you a "bonsai" tree. Bonsai trees will give you drops just like a tree, but without the wasted CPU of placing all the tree blocks just to chop them down again.

This can be significant overhead on a server, so if you want to be nice, breed some bonsai trees for your pyrolyze ovens. They also drop a ton and are fast, especially statted up, so there's no reason not to if you can automate them.ANDpreRequIC2/blockCrop~0Quest Name For 718718rewardsChoiceIC2/itemFertilizer~0Choice Name64Itemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~51Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalIC2/itemCropSeed~0IC2/itemCropSeed~0 Name1
