Place the circuit in the Input Bus\nEach 900K over the min. Heat required reduces power consumption by 5% (multiplicatively)\nEach 1800K over the min. Heat required grants one perfect overclock\nFor each perfect overclock the EBF will reduce recipe time 4 times (instead of 2) (100% efficiency)\nAdditionally gives +100K for every tier past MV\nCauses: 102400 pollution per second\n-----------------------------------------\nHold [LSHIFT] to display structure guidelines\nAdded by: bartimaeusnek via BartWorks
