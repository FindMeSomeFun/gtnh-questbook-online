1011§9§lFind BauxiteThe Bauxite vein contains two ores that get you Titanium, Bauxite and Ilmenite. Bauxite also contains Aluminium, as does (obviously) the Aluminium ore. You want tons of Titanium, so collect a bunch.

When you're mining you'll surely pick up some Meteoric Iron from small ores, enough to make your rocket.
