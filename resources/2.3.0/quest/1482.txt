1482§5§6§lPortable Prospecting ToolNow that you have some tech, you've discovered a way to prospect for ores. This tool only has a chance at finding the ores in a chunk. If you are clever, you can use it to locate ores.

Unfortunately, the tech to make it repairable or rechargeable doesn't work, so you'll have to make a new one each time it breaks. It does work better at higher tiers and lasts longer with better materials.

It doesn't make a convenient book like the Seismic Prospector, but you can look at the results of scanning on the map, thanks to Visual Prospecting.

It can be hard to choose a good material for the Basic Prospector. Here are some good choices for you in their respective tiers, the size searched, and the average amount of veins they can scan:

LV Vanadiumsteel 3x3 - 50
MV Vanadiumsteel 3x3 - 213
HV Vibrant Alloy 5x5 - 299
EV Shadow Metal 7x7 - 1080
IV Oriharukon 7x7 - 2649

Each chunk successfully scanned costs 100 durability. Each failed chunk costs 25. The average for MV is ~55 per chunk when scanning a large area. As you can see, the prospectors become better and better with each tier, so craft one whenever you think you need it.

Good luck.ANDpreRequ1477gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32691tasksANDretrievalgregtech/gt.detrav.metatool.01~41rewardsitemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~326911gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~327022enhancedlootbags/lootbag~51itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~025
