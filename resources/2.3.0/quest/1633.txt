You can use it with GT machines. Just put in the matrix that it should insert and the output is what it should extract. A great use for them is in combination with fluid canners or super tanks for filling cells. I would strongly recommend not overusing them. Wait untill you have access to AE2 for autocrafting stuff.ANDpre16310ProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.routingchip-5.pngrewardsChoiceProjRedCore/projectred.core.part-0.pngCircuit Plate
