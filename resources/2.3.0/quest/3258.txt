3258Botania/lexicon-0.png1A Botanist's Best Friend35-1Functional flowers are a large part of Botania. Most of them have nuances to how they operate, and these are generally best explained in the Lexica Botania: a codex of all Botania knowledge. This questline will explain the basics, but be sure to keep a copy of the Lexica Botania on hand so you can easily reference the details.

Besides being a repository of useful information, the Lexica Botania has another function: if, while holding it, you look at any Botania block in the world, you can shift+right click on that block to open up the relevant page.

Something else you'll want for functional flowers is a handful of redstone roots. Flowers which have a redstone root in their recipe have the ability to toggle whether they are active by applying a redstone signal. Make a few before you move on.ANDpre32201Botania/grassSeeds-0.pngrewardsChoiceBotania/mushroom-0.pngWhite Shimmering Mushroom;May work as an Infusion Stabilizer
