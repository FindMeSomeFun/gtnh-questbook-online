3258A Botanist's Best FriendFunctional flowers are a large part of Botania. Most of them have nuances to how they operate, and these are generally best explained in the Lexica Botania: a codex of all Botania knowledge. This questline will explain the basics, but be sure to keep a copy of the Lexica Botania on hand so you can easily reference the details.

Besides being a repository of useful information, the Lexica Botania has another function: if, while holding it, you look at any Botania block in the world, you can shift+right click on that block to open up the relevant page.

Something else you'll want for functional flowers is a handful of redstone roots. Flowers which have a redstone root in their recipe have the ability to toggle whether they are active by applying a redstone signal. Make a few before you move on.AND3220Botania/grassSeeds~0ANDretrievalBotania/lexicon~01retrievalBotania/manaResource~64choiceBotania/mushroom~04Botania/mushroom~14Botania/mushroom~24Botania/mushroom~34Botania/mushroom~44Botania/mushroom~54Botania/mushroom~64Botania/mushroom~74Botania/mushroom~84Botania/mushroom~94Botania/mushroom~104Botania/mushroom~114Botania/mushroom~124Botania/mushroom~134Botania/mushroom~144Botania/mushroom~154itemdreamcraft/item.CoinFlowerI~05Botania/manaResource~62
