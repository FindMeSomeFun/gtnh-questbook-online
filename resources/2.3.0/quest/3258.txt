3258A Botanist's Best FriendFunctional flowers are a large part of Botania. Most of them have nuances to how they operate, and these are generally best explained in the Lexica Botania: a codex of all Botania knowledge. This questline will explain the basics, but be sure to keep a copy of the Lexica Botania on hand so you can easily reference the details.

Besides being a repository of useful information, the Lexica Botania has another function: if, while holding it, you look at any Botania block in the world, you can shift+right click on that block to open up the relevant page.

Something else you'll want for functional flowers is a handful of redstone roots. Flowers which have a redstone root in their recipe have the ability to toggle whether they are active by applying a redstone signal. Make a few before you move on.ANDpreRequBotania/grassSeeds~0Quest Name For 32203220rewardsChoiceBotania/mushroom~0Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~1Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~2Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~3Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~4Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~5Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~6Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~7Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~8Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~9Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~10Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~11Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~12Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~13Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~14Choice Name4Botania/mushroom~15Choice Name4Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinFlowerI~0Item Name5Botania/manaResource~6Item Name2tasksANDRetrievalBotania/lexicon~0Botania/lexicon~0 Name1RetrievalBotania/manaResource~6Botania/manaResource~6 Name4
