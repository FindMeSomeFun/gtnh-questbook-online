betterquesting/submit_station-0.png§3§lSubmission StationAlthough many of the questing tasks can be submitted directly through your inventory (including liquids) sometimes you need a more automated solution. This is where the Object Submission Station (OSS) comes in handy. 

Tasks supporting the OSS can be selected through the built in interface to enable its use. Once setup, liquids and items can be either piped in or dropped into the interface's input slot. It will not void items or liquids if no task is selected or if it has already been completed, however, making it relatively safe from accidental item/fluid deletion. Multiple OSS are also capable of taking on separate sub-tasks under the same quest simultaneously!

§3PS: No quests actually require this at the moment, so feel free to ignore it.0-1ANDpre651gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11305.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11305.pngSteel Ingot\nFe\u2085\u2080C
