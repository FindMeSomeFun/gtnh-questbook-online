Almost any fruit can be converted to jelly with sugar and a saucepan. There are a few different nut butters available. Peanuts can be found in Ground Gardens in forest, mountain, or taiga style biomes. Cashews are trees located in jungles or swamps. Chestnuts can be found in warmer forests. Pistachios can be found in jungles. Many of these saplings are also available for trade from villagers.

Use a Forestry Worktable to keep all your recipes together in one spot for easy crafting.

Some sandwiches have better saturation than others, so be sure to check before buying that sapling!ANDpre6360minecraft/bread-0.png6650harvestcraft/potItem-0.pngrewardsItemharvestcraft/cherryjellysandwichItem-0.pngCherry Jelly Sandwich
