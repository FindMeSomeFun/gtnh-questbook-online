668Rubber BoatThe rubber dinghy requires only a few rubber plates. Like the vanilla wooden boat, it will break and dismantle whenever it hits a surface, however instead of returning sticks and planks, it will return a damaged rubber dinghy, which can be re-crafted with two pieces of rubber back into a useable rubber dinghy!AND666minecraft/boat~0ANDretrievalIC2/itemBoat~11choicegregtech/gt.metaitem.01~178808minecraft/waterlily~016enhancedlootbags/lootbag~321itemdreamcraft/item.CoinAdventure~015dreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~015
