Try an Iron Scythe! When used, it clears out a 5x5x5 area of leaves, crops, flowers, or grass. Excellent for tearing through Sacred Oak leaves or dense shrubbery in certain biomes. Later when you have a Cutting Machine you can upgrade to a Diamond Scythe with a 7x7x7 area of effect, or use Amethyst for 9x9x9 to FLEX.

The lower tiers break leaves instantly, but don't seem to have the 3x3x3 range for some reason.ANDpre361gregtech/gt.metatool.01-16.pngrewardsChoicegregtech/gt.blockores-32.pngIron Ore;Fe
