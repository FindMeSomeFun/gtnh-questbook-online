2720§2§lToo Many LeavesWant to clear out shrubbery but don't want to pull out leaves by hand? Need to find that last log hidden in the middle of a bunch of leaves?

Try an Iron Scythe! When used, it clears out a 5x5x5 area of leaves, crops, flowers, or grass. Excellent for tearing through Sacred Oak leaves or dense shrubbery in certain biomes. Later when you have a Cutting Machine you can upgrade to a Diamond Scythe with a 7x7x7 area of effect, or use Amethyst for 9x9x9 to FLEX.
