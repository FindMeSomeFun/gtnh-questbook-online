2282OceanThe Ocean bee can be hard to breed since some servers use a worldgen that prevents ocean biomes from appearing. You might have luck trying in a Twilight Forest lake - you'll know you are in the right biome if you see Water Creepers! If you have trouble locating an appropriate spot, you can also purchase Ocean bees from the Coins tab. Breed them from Diligent and Water.ANDpreRequForestry/beeQueenGE~0Quest Name For 11171117rewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag~25Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalForestry/beePrincessGE~0Forestry/beePrincessGE~0 Name1
