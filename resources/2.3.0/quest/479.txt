Be sure to bring a tough companion along to keep you alive. If you have no friends, why not make an Iron Golem and push it through first, or bring the materials for more along with you?

Also, when you die here, not if, your graves will spawn skeletons because of the darkness. Make sure you light up areas where you might die, and when recovering graves light up the area first so that you don't end up dying over and over and making a mess.

Watch out for some mobs! They'll take minimal damage from any weapon that is not their weakness. So if you seem to not be doing much damage, you probably aren't! Think about other options to hurt/kill the monster.ANDpre4781minecraft/flint_and_steel-0.pngrewardsItemNatura/natura.armor.imphelmet-0-enchanted.pngImpskin Helmet
