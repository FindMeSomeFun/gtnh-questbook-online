641§5§lNaphthaYou can process Sulfuric Naphtha to fluid Naphtha which has a burn value of 320,000 EU in the Gas Turbine. Naphtha can be used to get Rthylene for Polyethylene, but it shares this use with Refinery Gas and Light Fuel, so decide for yourself which one you want to use. 

If you choose to make High-Octane Gasoline in EV and onwards, it will need a lot of Naphtha. You can also make Polycaprolactam (Nylon), which doesn't have any useful purpose yet, but it might get some in the near future.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~421Quest Name For 543543gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30001Quest Name For 550550gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30736Quest Name For 639639rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~4Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinChemistI~0Item Name3tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30739gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30739 Name9
