3292miscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5-14.png0Tier 4 Transforming18-1The final tier of the QFT, built on many stacks of Spacetime. When it's complete, you will have access to all the skips currently in the game, the new ones being the bio cell skip, the Kevlar skip and the Radox + Xenoxene skip.

The third item - Black Body Naquadria Supersolid. Even through all the upgrades made beforehand, it’s still not possible to reach the stage of chemical skips for the items that are used to build the first QFT, such as the bioware circuits. This is the theoretical limit of the multi, and reaching this limit needs a material obtained from the second half of the Naquadah line. This new Naquadria-related substance has the characteristics of a black body, a material that absorbs all radiation it receives and reflects none, and is a supersolid, which is to say, a solid that flows like a fluid that has zero viscosity. By applying these qualities together, through a single material, it’s possible to guarantee easy and steady flow of quantum energy at any EU level, even in the MAX tier. With all these advances put together, the QFT is fully unlocked and can create components up to those made in the UHV tier.ANDpre32910miscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5-13.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalmiscutils/gtplusplus.blockcasings.5-10.pngSpaceTime Continuum Rippe;Mobs cannot Spawn on this Block;This is NOT a TileEntity!
