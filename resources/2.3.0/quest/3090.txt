Precise mode is used to make some of the advanced components from Good Generator mod.

Normal mode works as multiblock version of Assembler.

§3You can't skip tiers with this. You need singleblock Assembler or GT++ multi to make your first Energy Hatch, then you can use it for Precise Assembler.ANDpre23211gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-2084.png28301gregtech/gt.blockmachines-45.png28781gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-2052.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-8-enchanted.pngLootBag\nYour luck is increased by 100 %\nFortune III\nEnchant with a Fortune III Book
