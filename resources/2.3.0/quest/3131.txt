Nitric Acid is a bit more convoluted, but you might have already automated it, since it's needed for Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Ammonia and Oxygen can make it, or Nitrogen Dioxide instead of Ammonia. You won't be able to do it in a single step, but a small line of Chemical Reactor, or their multiblock equivalent, will do it for you.ANDpre31270gregtech/gt.blockcasings4-2.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30659.pngAmmonia Cell;NH\u2083
