1737minecraft/redstone-0.png0More Red, Less Wheat13-1When breeding together crops for an output crop, try to get crops that are close in tier to the output crop, and have similar attributes to the output crop. 

For example, Redwheat has "Red", "Wheat" and "Redstone" attributes and is tier 6. Netherwart has "Red" and is tier 5. Use the cropnalyzer crop prediction mode to see how many points Redwheat has using two Netherwart. 

You'll also want to make sure the light level is between 5-10 for this particular cross breeding to occur. Honestly, it's the worst, condition-wise.

Really though, once you get to MV it's better to make a Glowstone crop and centrifuge it for redstone. Or a redstone block crop. Or just mine it, honestly. Red wheat == Dead wheat.ANDpre12880IC2/itemHops-0.pngrewardsItemdreamcraft/item.CoinFarmerII-0.pngCoin "The Farmer 100"
