2993Basic CrackingDespite what the Distillery recipe might have led you to believe, there are many more fractions of Oil than the four you could choose from. However, to get the rest of the oil byproducts, you need to split these four into the others, a process known as cracking. To crack the fuels, they must not be sulfuric, and you will need either Hydrogen (hydro-cracking) or Steam (steam-cracking) to successfully crack. Your Hydrogen source for dessulfurizing is hopefully good enough to sustain hydro-cracking, and the Steam you were previously using for power can now be useful to get more out of the Oil you're pumping.

Heavy Fuel, Light Fuel, Refinery Gas and Naphtha can each be cracked both ways, and with three different intensities: lightly, moderately or severely cracked. This means that each portion has 6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling them can be cracked once more! There are a lot of options here, but a few of them stand out for their usefulness.

The first one you should attempt starts with Refinery Gas, instead of Light Fuel, so switch your Distillery to produce that, and get some Steam.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.blockmachines~1110Quest Name For 29922992rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~4Choice Name1gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32630Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinChemistI~0Item Name5tasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~421gregtech/gt.blockmachines~421 Name1gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30735gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~30735 Name10gregtech/gt.metaitem.98~0gregtech/gt.metaitem.98~0 Name10
