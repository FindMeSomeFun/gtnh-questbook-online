1764Basic Power DisplayFor this part we will learn how to use our adapter, place it next to, let's say your EBFs battery buffer and connect it to the computer with cables.
Now lets type in lua while on the computer to open the LUA environment where we can test things without worrying about saving and trying our program.

Type in 'component.list()' this will display a table of all of .list from component. What we're looking for is gt_batterybuffer.
If you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.

So now assign a variable to it; for example 'a = component.gt_batterybuffer'; now we can call 'a' to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.
What we'll be using in this example is the 'getBatteryCharge' method. So type  'a.getBatteryCharge(1)' this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.

So if we're using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like, 'for i=1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end'
Poof you now see what all the batteries EU values. Now what can we do with this?

Try making a variable called 'batteryCharge = 0', now do 'for i=1, 4 do batteryCharge = batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end'

Now print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here's a program example of this being used.

Place in your tape drive and type 'install', and follow the promps to install it into C. Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.

I suppose that's enough for now; congrats! Experiment and learn, and don't forget to check google as much as possible!  
This questline will be updated again in the future; but I figure this is a good ending point for now.AND1763OpenComputers/item~5ANDcheckboxOpenComputers/cable~3276716itemOpenComputers/item~41
