3234DTPFCongratulations, you have reached the Dimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge, one of the most lategame multiblocks in the pack. This monster will make a MEBF look like a toaster by comparison to the raw smelting power available here.

This multiblock has numerous powerful recipes at its disposal, including the ability to cook 4,096 neutronium in parallel for a reduced EU cost and the conversion of infinity catalyst directly into infinity at a 1:1 ratio. This comes at a great cost and will likely be a harsh test on your infrastructure.AND2588eternalsingularity/eternal_singularity~02590gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~325952591gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~326093217gregtech/gt.blockcasings5~113236gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32157ANDretrievalgregtech/gt.blockcasings~121
