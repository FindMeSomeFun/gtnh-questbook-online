3234DTPFCongratulations, you have reached the Dimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge, one of the most lategame multiblocks in the pack. This monster will make a MEBF look like a toaster by comparison to the raw smelting power available here.

This multiblock has numerous powerful recipes at its disposal, including the ability to cook 4,096 neutronium in parallel for a reduced EU cost and the conversion of infinity catalyst directly into infinity at a 1:1 ratio. This comes at a great cost and will likely be a harsh test on your infrastructure.ANDpreRequeternalsingularity/eternal_singularity~0Quest Name For 25882588gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32595Quest Name For 25902590gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32609Quest Name For 25912591gregtech/gt.blockcasings5~11Quest Name For 32173217gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32157Quest Name For 32363236rewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~1004gregtech/gt.blockmachines~1004 Name1gregtech/gt.blockcasings~14gregtech/gt.blockcasings~14 Name1gregtech/gt.blockcasings~13gregtech/gt.blockcasings~13 Name1gregtech/gt.blockcasings~12gregtech/gt.blockcasings~12 Name1
