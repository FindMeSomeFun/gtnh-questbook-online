gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1004.pngDTPFCongratulations, you have reached the Dimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge, one of the most lategame multiblocks in the pack. This monster will make a MEBF look like a toaster by comparison to the raw smelting power available here.

This multiblock has numerous powerful recipes at its disposal, including the ability to cook 4,096 neutronium in parallel for a reduced EU cost and the conversion of infinity catalyst directly into infinity at a 1:1 ratio. This comes at a great cost and will likely be a harsh test on your infrastructure.1-1ANDpre25881eternalsingularity/eternal_singularity-0.png25901gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32595.png25911gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32609.png32171gregtech/gt.blockcasings5-11.png32361gregtech/gt.metaitem.03-32157.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines-1004.pngDimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge\nTranscending Dimensional Boundaries.\nTakes 8 hours of continuous run time to fully breach dimensional\nboundaries and achieve maximum efficiency. This reduces fuel\nconsumption by up to 50%.
