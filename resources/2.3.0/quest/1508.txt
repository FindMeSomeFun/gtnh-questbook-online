You can also use it to upgrade tools with 8 modifiers at a time. Very handy for additional speed or looting!

When it's placed next to a vanilla chest, it will even show the chest's inventory in the crafting window. Single or double vanilla chests only please.

Cut it again for a sleek, low profile version.ANDpre361gregtech/gt.metatool.01-16.pngrewardsItemdreamcraft/item.CoinSmith-0.pngCoin "Blacksmith 1
