576Working Table 2.0A manual crafting table which remembers the last nine used recipes. Left click one of the recipes shown in the right-hand side to automatically fill in the crafting grid. Right-click to lock a memorized recipe and prevent a newer recipe from bumping it off.

Resources need to go into the internal inventory. The crafting matrix is only a visual representation.

The Forestry worktable is super-useful, and can reduce the tedium of many common jobs because you can click-drag across a row of items, and it will use tools in its own inventory to continue crafting.

Specifically:
Making <Item X> with <Bucket of Y> - Put all the ingredients into the table, and if the recipe is selected, shift click the result to craft them all at once (until you run out)
Making fresh water for Pam's - Same as above, but no second item
Making clay bricks - The wooden form is automatically reused
Making anything that uses a tool - Also automatically reused, while consuming durability
