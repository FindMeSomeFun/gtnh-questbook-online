You can make it out of any GT material, but the best right now is NORMAL Draconium. §4Always test in Creative first!§r

When using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.

If you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250% of optimal flow to produce 158% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400% of optimal flow to produce 214% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550% of optimal flow to produce 301% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.

The choice is yours!
