1261§a§lNanoprocessor MainframeThe nanoprocessor mainframe is the first LuV Circuit, and the end of this circuit line produced in EV. To craft the Tier 2 Rocket and reach Mars, Phobos and Deimos, you need to reach this circuit and make 8 of it.

After that, you will be able to progress into IV much more easily, but you will need two more circuits to make the IV Circuit Assembling Machine.AND1251gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32084ANDoptional_retrievalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~138032retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~327061choicegregtech/gt.blockmachines~411516gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~320398gregtech/gt.metaitem.03~320118enhancedlootbags/lootbag~71itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~02
