1261§a§lNanoprocessor MainframeThe nanoprocessor mainframe is the first LuV Circuit, and the end of this circuit line produced in EV. To craft the Tier 2 Rocket and reach Mars, Phobos and Deimos, you need to reach this circuit and make 8 of it.

After that, you will be able to progress into IV much more easily, but you will need two more circuits to make the IV Circuit Assembling Machine.ANDpreRequgregtech/gt.metaitem.03~32084Quest Name For 12511251rewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag~7Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianII~0Item Name2tasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.blockmachines~1380gregtech/gt.blockmachines~1380 Name32Retrievalgregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32706gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~32706 Name1
