All 3 can only work on crops up to a certain tier, determined by the tier of the machine you made and the crop you're working with. Basically, it's (crop tier+2)/2, rounded up. So an LV machine can work on T1 crops, but an MV one can work on T3.

LV=T1, MV=T3, HV=T5, EV=T7, IV=T9, LuV=T11, ZPM=T13, UV=T15, UHV=T17.

First is the Crop Gene Extractor:
It takes an existing crop seedbag, an empty Data Orb (See EV quests), and 1A while running. Use a circuit to determine what stat to copy to the Data Orb. You'll probably want either 23-31-0, or 31-31-0 for max speed and output, since you won't be breeding from these. Remember to take proper precautions if going over 23, as they will attempt to weed everything around them. There's a significant number of crops, so you'll probably need a ton of Orbs too, unless you want to reuse them. Remember to keep a Data Orb or seedbag backup!

Second is the Crop Synthesizer:
It takes 4 Data Orbs, one for each of the types from the CGE, 1000L of UUM per crop tier/2 (this is not rounded), and 16A while running. It will create a new crop seedbag with the desired stats.

Lastly is the Crop Replicator:
It takes an existing crop seedbag, 1000L per crop tier of UUM, and 6A while running. After finishing, it gives you back two of the same seedbag, duplicating it. This takes twice as much UUM, but less power, it's up to you whether that's worth it.ANDpre7210Natura/N Crops-0.png24150witchery/ingredient-106.pngrewardstasksANDCheckboxother/checkbox-.pngCheckbox
