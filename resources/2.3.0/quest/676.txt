Hold a crowbar and shift + right click to attach carts. Click the starting cart then continue to click to add more carts to the link. Carts will act slower the more connections are made.

The crowbar can be used as a weapon, though it costs twice as much durability on attack (just like any other non weapon tool...).ANDpre6750Railcraft/signal-4.pngrewardsChoiceminecraft/minecart-0.pngMinecart
