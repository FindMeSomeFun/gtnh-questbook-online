725Flower PowerGrowing dyes on crops sticks? Try to plant some flowers. If you cross breed Rose and Dandelion flowers maybe you'll get a new flower and new dyes with different colors.

You will need to plant 4 vanilla flowers to get them on a cropstick. They also don't plant unless they are in bright light.

To get "Rose Seeds" place poppies. Honestly there's several flowers you can use, though.
