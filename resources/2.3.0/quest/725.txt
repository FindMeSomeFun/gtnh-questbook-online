You will need to plant 4 vanilla flowers to get them on a cropstick. They also don't plant unless they are in bright light.

To get "Rose Seeds" place poppies. Honestly there's several flowers you can use, though.

ยง3If you actually want these for dyes, go make the rainbow cactus instead.ANDpre7180IC2/blockCrop-0.pngrewardsChoiceIC2/itemCropSeed-0.pngBlackthorn Seeds;Gr 1;Ga 1;Re 1
