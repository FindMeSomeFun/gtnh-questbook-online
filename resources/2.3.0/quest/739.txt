Now that you are familiar with the mod it's time to organize items in your base a bit. These are the things you need in order to get a basic extract/insert system.

First of all you will need a drawer controller. You can pick it from here or craft it yourself and place it down. Next to it add as much drawers as you want, and make sure they are touching each other or the controller.

The next step is to connect a routed interface pipe to your drawer controller. Take the item responder chip and configure it to filter mode: blacklist (this will allow you to get any items from your system) and add the chip to the routed interface pipe by right clicking on it. Don't forget the dynamic item responder.

In order to allow your system to be able to see items you need to add the item broadcast chip TO THE SAME ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE DRAWER CONTROLLER.

The last step is to connect a routed request pipe IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE and right click it to access the GUI. You can only extract items from it. In order to insert items simply right click them on the drawer controller. 

You can find more complex tutorials on youtube for autocrafting.ANDpre7370ProjRedCore/projectred.core.drawplate-44.png7380ProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.routingchip-1.pngrewardsChoiceStorageDrawers/controller-0.pngDrawer Controller
