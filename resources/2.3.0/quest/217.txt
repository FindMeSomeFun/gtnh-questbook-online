When you first activate the portal, you can configure the world to your liking: it can be a void world, or any superflat world as long as it only consists of blocks such as grass, stone, cobblestone, bedrock, etc.
Be careful! Once you configure the world, you can only change the cosmetic settings such as sky color by shift-right clicking the portal.
Editing world generation settings after the world is created is only possible if a server administrator unlocks it for you via the /pspace allow-worldgen-change DIMID command.

ยง3PS: The Last Millenium is also a void dimension you could use.
