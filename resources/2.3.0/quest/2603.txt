1) EBF Crushed Lead Ore for 2 Tellurium Nuggets
2) If you have old worldgen, you can get it from Temagamite practically anywhere (it was broken so it currently doesn't generate), or Mercury if it's been fixed
3) Make Rare Earth (III) out of Rare Earth using the strongest of acids and get it from Alburnite
4) Toxic Everglades again
