2642Rocket Tier 7You can now visit the planets on the edge of the solar system with this rocket.

You need to use H8N4C2O4 (Green) Rocket Fuel to fuel it.

ยง3If you started on an older version of GTNH and still have some Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine Fuel Mix, you can also use that as rocket fuel! But you can't make any more of it, so better look into H8N4C2O4 anyway.ANDpreRequGalaxySpace/item.RocketControlComputer~7Quest Name For 27022702dreamcraft/item.ExtraLargeFuelCanister~0Quest Name For 27032703dreamcraft/item.HeavyDutyRocketEngineTier4~0Quest Name For 27052705dreamcraft/item.HeavyDutyRocketFinsTier4~0Quest Name For 27062706dreamcraft/item.HeavyDutyNoseConeTier4~0Quest Name For 27072707rewardstasksANDRetrievalGalaxySpace/item.Tier7Rocket~0GalaxySpace/item.Tier7Rocket~0 Name1
