The security system does not prevent destructive tampering, removing cables / machines or breaking of drives. If you need to protect your system from physical vandalism you will need another form of physical security. This block provides network level security.

The player who places the ME security terminal has full control over the network and cannot exclude himself any rights. By adding a blank biometric card you define a default behavior for every player who has no biometric card registered.

In addition to security on the software layer, you can link up your wireless terminal with the network and access it wirelessly.

If you have one on your main network, your subnets may also need one to have access to your main network, but this is not always the case depending on how you set it up.


The ME Wireless Access Point wireless access via a wireless terminal. Range and power usage is determined based on the number of wireless boosters installed into the ME wireless access point.
