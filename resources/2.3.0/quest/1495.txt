1495§1§lAll Alone in the NightIf you are playing single player, updates mean having to reload the questbook. Use the Default Load Block to do it for you without having to enter creative mode - you don't lose progress, but you'll have new quests to complete! Use the items to craft it, then place it and right-click.

Sorry, no rewards, other than the satisfaction of knowing it's you versus the world.
