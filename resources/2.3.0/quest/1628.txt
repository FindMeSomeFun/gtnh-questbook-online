1628ProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.routingchip-2.png0Item Overflow Chip25-1This chip stores the items in a connected inventory. It designates a storage for items that have no other place to go. It is strongly recomended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with a large chest (diamond for example).

It seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.

You might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to your overflow spot.ANDpre16260ProjRedCore/projectred.core.part-44.pngrewardsChoiceProjRedCore/projectred.core.part-0.pngCircuit Plate
