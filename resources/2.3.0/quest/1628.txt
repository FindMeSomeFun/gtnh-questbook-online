1628Item Overflow ChipThis chip stores the items in a connected inventory. It designates a storage for items that have no other place to go. It is strongly recomended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with a large chest (diamond for example).

It seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.

You might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to your overflow spot.ANDpreRequProjRedCore/projectred.core.part~44Quest Name For 16261626rewardsChoiceProjRedCore/projectred.core.part~0Choice Name2IC2/itemPartCircuit~0Choice Name1gregtech/gt.blockmachines~2000Choice Name8ProjRedCore/projectred.core.part~44Choice Name1enhancedlootbags/lootbag~4Choice Name1Itemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnician~0Item Name15ItemProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.routingchip~0Item Name1tasksANDRetrievalProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.routingchip~2ProjRedTransportation/projectred.transportation.routingchip~2 Name1
