Fill it with water on the bottom side to produce steam. Unlike the other boilers, this only outputs steam on the output port side.

§4Hint: The solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time. Later on you can consider using distilled water to avoid calcification.

§3You'll need silver from the Twilight Forest (LV+) or from small ores for this.ANDpre620gregtech/gt.blockmachines-105.png761gregtech/gt.blockmachines-140.png9481gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11304.pngrewardsItemharvestcraft/kiwijellysandwichItem-0.pngKiwi Jelly Sandwich\nharvestcraft:kiwijellysandwichItem
