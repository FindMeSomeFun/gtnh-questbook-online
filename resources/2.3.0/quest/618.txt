On the other hand if you've made some light fuel you'll have some spare hydrogen sulfide you can also turn into sulfuric acid (after a couple steps), and if you've automated it, you'll be drowning in it honestly. Once you can make an LCR, you can skip directly from HS to SA in one step. Keep in mind that you'll need all that acid for making stuff instead of for single use batteries by then.ANDpre6170gregtech/gt.blockmachines-431.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-2022.pngSulfur Dust;S;Burn Time: 1600
