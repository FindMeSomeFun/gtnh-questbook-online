If you haven't started on defeating the TF bosses yet, you'll need to do so to proceed. All wands require some kind of TF boss drop, with better wands needing later boss's drops. Once you've defeated them once, you can buy a spawn egg (only usable in the TF) or use the trophy+salis mundus to make more of the drop.
