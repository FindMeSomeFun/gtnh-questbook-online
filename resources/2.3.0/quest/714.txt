714Convocation of the DamnedTime to open a portal to the Demonic Realm. What could possibly go wrong? (It's recommended to do this ritual on a space dim, as the demon city will spread quite a bit...)

It's complicated to explain, so check a wiki for details on how to actually do it. Remember you need to have 15M LP, so you'll need 25 Runes of the Orb to start it. Also, you need the Alchemic Calcinator and the other tools in the upper left of the BM thaumcraft tab for working with the belljars.

ยง3The OW is now blacklisted for the portal. Too many people did not follow the recommendation and servers had to suffer under it.ANDpreRequ707AWWayofTime/archmageBloodOrb~0710AWWayofTime/AlchemicalWizardrybloodRune~3tasksANDretrievalAWWayofTime/blockCrystalBelljar~01retrievalAWWayofTime/ritualStone~0128optional_retrievalAWWayofTime/activationCrystal~11rewardsitemAWWayofTime/demonicSlate~08enhancedlootbags/lootbag~181itemdreamcraft/item.CoinBloodIII~01
