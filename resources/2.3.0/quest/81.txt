Ingots that go through the EBF above a certain temperature will come out as hot ingots that need to be cooled.

You will need a minimum of 16 frost proof machine casings, the rest depends on your setup.ANDpre9401gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1172.png10141gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32704.pngrewardsItemharvestcraft/neapolitanicecreamItem-0.pngNeapolitan Ice Cream;harvestcraft:neapolitanicecreamItem
