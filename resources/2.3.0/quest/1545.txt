1545gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1158.png0§6§lTime to Drill For Ore!17-1Auto Miners are nice but you're going to reach a point where you will want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE ores. This multiblock will help with that.  It will also pre-macerate your ores and give you a little bonus crushed ores as well.

Higher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. You will also need an energy hatch, an input hatch, and an output bus - at least MV but you can choose.

Later you can upgrade the ore drilling plant so it extracts from more than a 48 block radius. If you don't want to mine that far away, adjust the range with a screwdriver. Each tier of the controller also gives 1 bonus fortune for small ores starting at 4. At tier 3 you'll want to spread the wealth to multiple compressed chests!

The multiblock miners have been upgraded so that they will chunkload the area they dig in. They will NOT chunkload themselves however. They will dig §odown§r in the chunk they're in like normal, and then dig §oup§r one chunk at a time in other chunks within its range.

You need mining pipes in the controller and drilling fluid in the fluid hatch. You can also feed mining pipes into an input bus.

You'll need to make lots of Drilling Fluid. 64 is a tiny amount to get started with! Plan to make thousands of buckets - perhaps onsite, or pumped in via Long Distance Fluid Pipes.

These are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain (and meteors!) on any side. And set a waypoint with JourneyMap so you don't forget where you placed it!ANDpre1761gregtech/gt.blockmachines-14.pngrewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag-7.pngLootBag;You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
