Note: After they're used up you can recycle them to get Lutetium which is used for making americium in the fusion reactor. Americium is needed for top tier materials later, so start stockpiling now. Plus, you get power!ANDpre1900IC2/blockGenerator-5.pngrewardsItemenhancedlootbags/lootbag-7.pngLootBag (Tier 4 EV);You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
