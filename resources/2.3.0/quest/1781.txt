1781Traveller's GearThe goggles, wings, shoes, vest, belt and boots itself are not really special. 

You can zoom with the googles, have a extra inventory hotbar with the belt, step-up assist with the shoes, jump boost with the wings and faster swimming ability with the vest.

You get protection like with normal armor too.

Later on you can upgrade your items to become more powerful ones.AND102gregtech/gt.blockmachines~251689minecraft/diamond_chestplate~0838IC2/itemPartCircuitAdv~0ANDoptional_retrievalIC2/itemPartCircuitAdv~06retrievalTConstruct/travelBoots~01choiceharvestcraft/hardenedleatherItem~032gregtech/gt.metaitem.01~1750016IC2/itemPartCircuitAdv~02enhancedlootbags/lootbag~54itemdreamcraft/item.CoinSmithI~05dreamcraft/item.CoinSurvivorI~05
