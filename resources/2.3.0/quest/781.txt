You will need tons of bronze, iron and steel to build it, but it's worth it. Finally, it will be possible to dismantle the charcoal pit.

With Cupronickel coils the oven is a bit slower. Each coil tier speeds up the charcoal production.ANDpre771gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1000.png7171gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32702.pngrewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag-5.pngLootBag (Tier 2 MV);You feel that a bit more "Fortune" might be a good idea...;Enchant with a Fortune III Book
