With these, you can now directly I/O items between GregTech multiblock and ME network. They have §osignificantly§r less lag, so please start using them as soon as possible on servers.

You just pop off your GT bus + ME bus or ME interface combination, and replace both with the new bus and connect a ME cable directly to it. It uses 1 channel, same as the other options.ANDpre13021appliedenergistics2/item.ItemMultiPart-440.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.blockmachines-2710.pngOutput Bus\nItem Output for Multiblocks\nStores directly into ME
