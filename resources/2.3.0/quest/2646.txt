2646Where No One Has Gone BeforeAnother rocket, another set of planets. Get to work already, that's why you made it, right?

There's only two new planets this time, Proteus and Triton. They're both moons of Neptune.

The new veins are Neutronium, Niobium, and Thorium. The ores are: Adamantium, Gallium, Naquadah, Neutronium, Niobium, Plutonium-241, Titanium, Uranium 235, Uranium-238, and Yttrium.

You can get Black Plutonium from small ores on Triton.

You should pick up some planet blocks while you're visiting.
