TConstruct/pickaxe-0-56.png§2§lYour First ToolWhen your tinkers tables are ready you can craft your first §oreal§r tool. If you didn't find a village yet (to grab some parts from the chest), you can only craft flint tools.

Let's start with a pickaxe, an axe and a shovel. At this point swords are unobtainable since they need metals like iron or bronze which you will get at a later stage. In the meantime use your gregtech swords.

Your new tools are weak at first, but the more you use them the better they will get. You get a modifer slot after some levels, needing more as you level it up. They will level up to level 99 if you play long enough, with 20 modifier slots. Tool parts can be replaced for a bit of level XP, however the tool must be fully repaired first.

You need to level up the mining level each time you replace the parts to unleash the full power of the pickaxe. Stone->Copper for this pickaxe. If you manage to get a Zombie, Skeleton, or Creeper head, you can use it to skip the level-up process. This doesn't use up a modifier level, but does change the look until you change the pickaxe part out.

Item=Usable when mining level is X or less
Zombie=1
Skeleton=2
Creeper=4
Wither Skeleton=7
Nether Star=8

§3You can use paper binding to add extra modifier, but not very much important as tool level exists.1-1ANDpre331TConstruct/ToolStationBlock-1.pngrewardsItemminecraft/flint-0.pngFlint
