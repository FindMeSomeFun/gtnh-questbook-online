To actually use it in circuits, you need to etch it. I guess by now, you know how to etch a circuit board, so I won't tell you and you have to use NEI :P1-1ANDpre26491gregtech/gt.metaitem.03-32073.pngrewardstasksANDOptionalgregtech/gt.metaitem.03-32006.pngWetware Lifesupport Circuit Board\nThe Board that keeps life
