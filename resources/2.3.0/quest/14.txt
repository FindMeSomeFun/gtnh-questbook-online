14§1§lWhat's That...?You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal. You're sure that these will be Very Important soon™.

The best place to find them is in a Magical Forest, but if you can't find one you can try a Garden or Cherry Wood Grove. Or just randomly everywhere.
