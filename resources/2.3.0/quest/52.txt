52minecraft/glass-0.png1A Clear View3-1Are you still living in your dirt/cobble hut? How about letting in some sunlight? Grind up some sand and flint and craft some glass dust. Put it in your smeltery and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass.

Hint: In order to use it for recipes, you have to chisel it.

PS: The macerator no longer gives tiny piles, just uncraft a normal pile to get tiny ones. You'll appreciate this once you have a mixer in LV.ANDpre491minecraft/piston-0.pngrewardsItemminecraft/cookie-0.pngCookie
