minecraft/glass-0.png§3§4§3§lA Clear ViewAre you still living in your dirt/cobble hut? How about letting in some sunlight? Grind up some sand and flint and craft some glass dust. Put it in your smeltery and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass.

§4Hint: In order to use it for recipes, you have to chisel it.

§3PS: The macerator no longer gives tiny piles, just uncraft a normal pile to get tiny ones. You'll appreciate this once you have a mixer in LV.1-1ANDpre491minecraft/piston-0.pngrewardsItemminecraft/cookie-0.pngCookie\nminecraft:cookie
