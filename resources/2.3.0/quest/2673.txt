Avaritia/Resource-4.pngNeutrons From SpaceNow let's make Cosmic Neutronium, a material that is used in a lot of late game stuff.
Centrifuge Black Plutonium to get a Pile of Neutrons. It can then be compressed to Cosmic Neutronium Nuggets in an Implosion Compressor.

Compress the nuggets again to make a Cosmic Neutronium Ingot.

ยง3Avaritia's Neutronium and GT Cosmic Neutronium are oredicted together, it's not the same as normal GT Neutronium. It goes back to being called SpNt if you craft it into something, like a plate.1-1ANDpre26131gregtech/gt.blockmachines-18.pngrewardstasksANDRetrievalAvaritia/Resource-4.pngCosmic Neutronium Ingot\nThe dense heart of a star in convenient ingot form.
