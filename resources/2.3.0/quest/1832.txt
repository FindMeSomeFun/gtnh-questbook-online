bartworks/BW_PaperRotor-0.png§6§lGrinding With WindThe Windmill is a grinder that uses the force of wind to macerate Items and Blocks. You will only get one crushed Ore from it sometimes. However it does give a bonus when you try to macerate other things. That bonus depends on the item inserted, for example Netherrack has a chance to give two instead of one dust and Wheat will always give one and a quarter flour.

The dispensers replace a clay block in the walls. Put anything you like in the interior - a bed, stairs, torches, etc.

Normal multiblock rules apply - do not cross chunk boundaries with this multiblock.

If this is your first GregTech multiblock, as with all the rest you will need to whack the controller with a soft mallet to activate it.

If you have troubles forming the multiblock, try breaking and replacing the controller block.

The controller can be fed items via hoppers etc to allow for larger batches. Just don't allow the dispenser to fill up or it will void outputs.

The rotor blades will run if the controller is disabled or has no recipe. Remove the blades when not in use or else they'll be used up.

Speed and output will be affected by wind speed, recipe, and rotor.

Macerates 16 items at a time.

High wind speeds will decrease output.

The durability will decrease according to the wind speed.0-1ORpre481gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11308.png18310minecraft/dispenser-0.pngrewardsItemdreamcraft/item.CoinTechnicianI-0.pngCoin "The Technician 10"
