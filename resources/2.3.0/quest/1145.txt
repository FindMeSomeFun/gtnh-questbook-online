But why not use your transformer to send the power back to base more efficiently, it's a loss of about 57/512EU per A just going from 160 straight down to 63 without it. If you transform up (after going through 1 block of cable to transform it to GT power), you only lose about 57/2048EU per A, much better.

IC2 machines don't care about rain, but remember to cover your transformer.ANDpre11400miscutils/itemwcarbonrotor-0.pngrewardsChoiceenhancedlootbags/lootbag-6.pngLootBag (Tier 3 HV)
