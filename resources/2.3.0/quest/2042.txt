Automagy/blockThirstyTank-0.pngSo Thirsty Just listening to this tank gulp water makes me thirsty. If placed next to a water source block, it is a decent water source. It also supports several upgrades to speed and capacity. Try out this glyph near your cows, and get a tank full of milk for all your cheese and butter needs.0-1ANDpre20500Automagy/blockGreedyChest-0.pngrewardsItemAutomagy/glyph-9.pngGlyph of the Bovine
