3200GalacticraftMars/item.spaceshipTier2-0.png0EV vs. IV23-1Your sourcing of Uranium is gonna be very small in EV, unless you use crops. Similarly, your ability to put together the multiblocks needed for the fluid nuke will be better in IV, since you can mine Small Titanium Ore directly, and use GT++ multis. 

All in all, it becomes very worthwhile to rush the Tier 2 Rocket and land on Mars and Phobos to get Uranium and Tungstate/Scheelite, before you go much farther with IC2 nukes. In IV, fluid nukes are one of the best choices for efficient power without a lot of setup, although it's very viable to use Thorium and not just Uranium.

Either way, it's recommended to have a multiblock Miner in either the Nether or Phobos, to source your Thorium or Uranium.ORpre31560gregtech/gt.blockmachines-1154.png31680gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-2098.pngrewardstasksAND
