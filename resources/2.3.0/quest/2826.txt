It still isn't as good as an LGT for power produced over time, but it can produce power faster. As long as you use it with the HP Steam Turbine.

It can produce 1A+ of LuV if you set it up right.ANDpre8601gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-11028.png12451gregtech/gt.metaitem.01-32653.pngrewardsItemgregtech/gt.metaitem.01-30686.pngBenzene Cell;C\u2086H\u2086
